<p>Let's start our Rust jorney! There's a lot to learn, but every journey starts somewhere. In this chapter, we'll discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing Rust on Linux, macOS, and Windows</li>
<li>Writing a program that prints <code>Hello, world!</code></li>
<li>Using <code>cargo</code>, Rust's package manager and build system</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installiation"><a class="header" href="#installiation">Installiation</a></h2>
<p>The first step is to install Rust. We'll download Rust through <code>rustup</code>, command line tool for managing Rust versions
and associated tools.</p>
<p>The following steps install the latest stable version of the Rust compiler.
Rust's stability guarantees ensure that all the examples in the book that compile will continue to compile with newer
Rust versions.</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">$ rustup update

<h3 id="local-documentation"><a class="header" href="#local-documentation">Local Documentation</a></h3>
<p>The installation of Rust also includes a local copy of the documentation so that you can read it offline.
Run <code>rustup doc</code> to open the local documentation in your browser.</p>
<p>Any time a type or function is provided by the standard library and you're not sure what it does or how to use it, use
the application programming interface (API) documentation to find out!</p>
<h2 id="hello-world"><a class="header" href="#hello-world">Hello, World!</a></h2>
<p>Now that you’ve installed Rust, it’s time to write your first Rust program.
It’s traditional when learning a new language to write a little program that
prints the text <code>Hello, world!</code> to the screen, so we’ll do the same here!</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-project-directory"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-project-directory">Creating a Project Directory</a></h3>
<p>You’ll start by making a directory to store your Rust code. It doesn’t matter to Rust where your code lives, but for the
exercises and projects in this book, we suggest making a projects directory in your home directory and keeping all your
projects there.
Open a terminal and enter the following commands to make a projects
directory and a directory for the “Hello, world!” project within the
projects directory.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world
</code></pre>
<h3 id="writing-and-running-a-rust-program"><a class="header" href="#writing-and-running-a-rust-program">Writing and Running a Rust Program</a></h3>
<p>Next, make a new source file and call it <code>main.rs</code>. Rust files always end with the <code>.rs</code> extension. If you're using more
than one word in your filename, the convention is to use an underscore to separate them. For example,
use <code>hello_world.rs</code> rather than <code>helloworld.rs</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>Hello, world!</code> did print, congratulations! You've officially written a Rust program. That makes you a Rust
programmer - welcome!</p>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-a-rust-program"><a class="header" href="#anatomy-of-a-rust-program">Anatomy of a Rust Program</a></h3>
<p>Let’s review this “Hello, world!” program in detail. Here’s the first piece of
the puzzle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
<span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
</span>}</code></pre>
<p>These lines define a function named <code>main</code>. The <code>main</code> function is special: it is always the first code that runs in
every executable Rust program. Here the first line declares a function named <code>main</code> that has no parameters and returns
nothing. If there were parameters, they would go inside the parentheses <code>()</code>.</p>
<p>The function body is wrapped in <code>{}</code>. Rust requires curly brackets around all function bodies. It's good style to place
the opening curly bracket on the same line as the function declaration, adding one space in between.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to stick to a standard style across Rust projects, you can use an automatic
formatter tool called rustfmt to format your code in a particular style (more on rustfmt
in Appendix D). The Rust team has included this tool with the standard Rust distribution, as rustc is, so it should
already be installed on your computer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The body of the <code>main</code> function hold the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>This line does all the work in this little program: it prints text to the screen. There are four important details to
notice here.</p>
<p>First, Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.</p>
<p>Second, <code>println!</code> calls a Rust macro. If it had called a function instead, it would be entered as <code>println</code>(without
the <code>!</code>). We'll discuss Rust macros in more detail in Chapter 19. For now, you just need to know that using a <code>!</code> means
that you're calling a macro instead of a normal function and that macros don't always follow the same rules as
functions.</p>
<p>Third, you see the <code>&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</code> string. We pass this string as an argument to <code>println!</code>, and the string is printed
to the screen.</p>
<p>Fourth, we end the line with a semicolon(<code>;</code>), which indicates that this expression is over and the next one is ready to
begin. Most lines of Rust code end with a semicolon.</p>
<h3 id="compiling-and-running-are-separate-steps"><a class="header" href="#compiling-and-running-are-separate-steps">Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps</a></h3>
<p>You've just run a newly created program, so let's examine each step in the process.</p>
<p>Before running a Rust program, you must compile it using the Rust compiler by entering the <code>rustc</code> command and passing
it the name of your source file, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ rustc main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>If you have a C or C++ background, you’ll notice that this is similar to
<code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code>. After compiling successfully, Rust outputs a binary executable.</p>
<p>You can see the executable by entering the <code>ls</code> command in your shell:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ ls
main.exe  main.pdb  main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>This shows the source code file with the <code>.rs</code> extension, the executable file (<code>main.exe</code> on Windows, but <code>main</code> on all
other platforms), and, when using Windows, a file containing debugging information with the <code>.pdb</code> extension.</p>
<p>Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else,
and they can run it even without having Rust installed.</p>
<p>Just compiling with <code>rustc</code> is fine for simple programs, but as your project grows, you'll want to manage all the
options and make it easy to share your code. Next, we'll introduce you to the Cargo tool, which will help you write
real-world Rust programs.</p>
<h2 id="hello-cargo"><a class="header" href="#hello-cargo">Hello, Cargo!</a></h2>
<p>Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager. Most Rustaceans use
this tool to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks
for you, such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code
depends on, and building those libraries. (We call the libraries that your
code needs dependencies.)</p>
<p>The simplest Rust programs, like the one we’ve written so far, don’t have
any dependencies. If we had built the “Hello, world!” project with Cargo, it
would only use the part of Cargo that handles building your code. As you
write more complex Rust programs, you’ll add dependencies, and if you start
a project using Cargo, adding dependencies will be much easier to do.</p>
<p>Because the vast majority of Rust projects use Cargo, the rest of this
book assumes that you’re using Cargo too. Cargo comes installed with Rust
if you used the official installers discussed in “Installation” on page 1. If you installed Rust through some other
means, check whether Cargo is installed by entering the following in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo --version
</code></pre>
<h3 id="creating-a-project-with-cargo"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-project-with-cargo">Creating a Project with Cargo</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo init
</code></pre>
<p>You'll see that Cargo has generated <code>Cargo.toml</code> file.</p>
<p>It has also initialized a new Git repository along with a <code>.gitignore</code> file. Git files won't be generated if you
run <code>cargo new</code> within an existing Git repository; you can override this behavior by using <code>cargo new --vcs=git</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[package]
name = &quot;hello_world&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
edition = &quot;2021&quot;

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]

[[bin]]
name = &quot;hello_world&quot;
path = &quot;main.rs&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This file is in the TOML(Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) format, which is Cargo's configuration format.</p>
<p>The first line, <code>[package]</code>, is a section heading that indicates that the following statements are configuring a
package. As we add more information to this file we'll add other sections.</p>
<p>The next three lines set the configuration information Cargo needs to compile your program: the name, the version, and
the edition of Rust to use.</p>
<p>The last line, <code>[dependencies]</code>, is the start of a section for you to list any of your project's dependencies. In Rust,
packages of code are referred to as <code>crates</code>. We won't need any other crates for this project, but we will in the first
project in Chapter 2, so we'll use this dependencies section then.</p>
<p>Cargo expects your source files to live inside the <code>src</code> directory. The top-level project directory is just for README
files, license information, configuration files, and anything else not related to your code. Using Cargo helps you
organize your projects. There's a place for everything, and everything is in its place.</p>
<h3 id="building-and-running-a-cargo-project"><a class="header" href="#building-and-running-a-cargo-project">Building and Running a Cargo Project</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build
</code></pre>
<p>This command creates an executable file in <code>target\debug\hello_cargo.exe</code> rather than in your current directory. Because
the default build is a debug build, Cargo puts the binary in a directory named <code>debug</code>. You can run the executable with
this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ ./target/debug/hello_world
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Running <code>cargo build</code> for the first time also causes Cargo to create a new file at the top level: <code>Cargo.lock</code>. This
file keeps track of the exact versions of dependencies in your project. This project doesn't have dependencies, so the
file is a bit sparse. You won't ever need to change this file manually; Cargo manages its contents for you.</p>
<p>We just built a project with cargo build and ran it with <code>./target/debug/ hello_world</code>, but we can also use <code>cargo run</code> to compile the code and then run
the resultant executable all in one command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running `target\debug\hello_world.exe`
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>cargo run</code> is more convenient that having to remember to run <code>cargo build</code> and then use the whole path to the
binary, so most developers use <code>cargo run</code>.</p>
<p>Notice that this time we didn't see output indicating that Cargo was compiling <code>hello_world</code>. Cargo figured out that the
files hadn't changed, so it didn't rebuild but just ran the binary. If you had modified your source code, Cargo would
have rebuilt the project before running it.</p>
<p>Cargo also provides a command called <code>cargo check</code>. This command quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but
doesn't produce an executable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo check
    Checking hello_world v0.1.0 (C:\Users\jerok\projects\study_blog\rust_lang_book\code\ch01\hello_world)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.07s
</code></pre>
<p>Why would you not want an executable? Often, <code>cargo check</code> is much faster then <code>cargo build</code> because it skips the step
of producing an executable. If you're continually checking your work while writing the code, using <code>cargo check</code> will
speed up the process of letting you know if your project is still compiling! As such, many Rustaceans run <code>cargo check</code>
periodically as they write their program to make sure it compiles. Then they run <code>cargo build</code> when they're ready to use
the executable.</p>
<p>Let's recap what we've learned so far about Cargo:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can create a project using <code>cargo new</code>.</li>
<li>We can build a project using <code>cargo build</code>.</li>
<li>We can build and run a project in one step using <code>cargo run</code>.</li>
<li>We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using <code>cargo check</code>.</li>
<li>Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the <code>target/debug</code>
directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>An additional advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the same no matter which operating system you're working
on. So, at this point, we'll no longer provide specific instructions for Linux and macOS versus Windows.</p>
<h3 id="building-for-release"><a class="header" href="#building-for-release">Building for Release</a></h3>
<p>When your project is finally ready for release, you can use <code>cargo build --release</code> to compile it with optimizations.
This command will create an executable in <code>target/release</code> instead of <code>target/debug</code>. The optimizations make your Rust
code run faster, but turning them on lengthens the time it takes for your program to compile. This is why there are two
different profiles: one for development, when you want to rebuild quickly and often, and another for building the final
program you'll give to a user that won't be rebuilt repeatedly and that will run as fast as possible. If you're
benchmarking your code's running time, be sure to run <code>cargo build --release</code> and benchmark with the executable
in <code>target/release</code>.</p>
<h3 id="cargo-as-convention"><a class="header" href="#cargo-as-convention">Cargo as Convention</a></h3>
<p>With simple projects, Cargo doesn't provide a lot of value over just using <code>rustc</code>, but it will prove its worth as your
programs become more intricate.
Once programs grow to multiple files or need a dependency, it's much easier to let Cargo coordinate the build.</p>
<p>Even though the <code>hello_cargo</code> project is simple, it now uses much of the real tooling you'll use in the rest of your
Rust career. In fact, to work on any existing projects, you can use the following commands to check out the code using
Git, change to that project's directory, and build:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">git clone example.org/someproject
cd someproject
cargo build
</code></pre>
<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>You're already off to a great start on your Rust journey! In this chapter, you've learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the latest stable version of Rust using <code>rustup</code></li>
<li>Update to a newer Rust version</li>
<li>Open locally installed documentation</li>
<li>Write and run a &quot;Hello, world!&quot; program using <code>rustc</code> directly</li>
<li>Create and run a new project using the conventions of Cargo</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a great time to build a more substantial program to get used to reading and writing RUst code. So, in Chapter 2,
we'll build a guessing game program. If you would rather start by learning how common programming concepts work in Rust,
see Chapter 3 and then return to Chapter 2.</p>

concepts by showing you how to use them in a real program. You'll learn about <code>let</code>, <code>match</code>, methods, associated
functions, external crates, and more.</p>

<p>The <code>run</code> command comes in handy when you need to rapidly iterate on a project, as we'll do in this game, quickly
testing each iteration before moving on to the next one.</p>
<h2 id="processing-a-guess"><a class="header" href="#processing-a-guess">Processing a Guess</a></h2>
<p>ex 2.1 Code that gets a guess from the user and prints it</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

<p>To obtain user input and then print the result as output, we need to bring the <code>io</code> input/output library into scope.
The <code>io</code> library comes from the standard library, known as <code>std:</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::io;
<span class="boring">

</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it brings into the scope of every program. This
set is called the prelude, and you can see everything in it at https://doc.rust-lang-org/std/prelude/index.html.</p>
<p>If a type you want to use isn't in the prelude, you have to bring that type into scope explicitly with a <code>use</code>
statement. Using the <code>std::io</code> library provides you with a number of useful features, including the ability to accept
user input.</p>
<p>the <code>main</code> function is the entry point into the program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span>fn main() {
<span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    let mut guess = String::new();
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    io::stdin()
</span><span class="boring">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)

</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>fn</code> syntax declares a new function; the parentheses, <code>()</code>, indicate there are no parameters; and the curly
bracket, <code>{</code>, starts the body of the function. <code>println!</code> is a macro that prints a string to the screen:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>This code is printing a prompt stating what the game is and requesting input from the user.</p>
<h3 id="storing-values-with-variables"><a class="header" href="#storing-values-with-variables">Storing Values with Variables</a></h3>
<p>We'll create a variable to store the user input, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span>    let mut guess = String::new();
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    io::stdin()
</span><span class="boring">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
</span><span class="boring">        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>We use the <code>let</code> statement to create the variable. Here's another example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let apples = 5;</code></pre>
<p>This line creates a new variable named <code>apples</code> and binds it to the value <code>5</code>. In Rust, variables are immutable by
default, meaning once we give the variable a value, the value won't change. We'll be discussing this concept in detail
in &quot;Variables and Mutability&quot;. To make a variable mutable, we add <code>mut</code> before the variable name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let apples = 5;  // immutable
let mut bananas = 5;  // mutable</code></pre>
<p><code>let mut guess</code> will introduce a mutable variable named <code>guess</code>. The equal sign (<code>=</code>) tells Rust we want to bind
something to the variable now. On the right of the equal sign is the value that <code>guess</code> is bound to, which is the result
of calling <code>String::new</code>, a function that returns a new instance of a <code>String</code>. <code>String</code> is a string type provided by
the standard library that is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text.</p>
<p>The <code>::</code> syntax in the <code>::new</code> line indicates that <code>new</code> is an associated function of the <code>String</code> type. An associated
function is a function that's implemented on a type, in this case <code>String</code>. This <code>new</code> function creates a new, empty
string. You'll find a <code>new</code> function on many types because it's a common name for a function that makes a new value of
some kind.</p>
<p>In full, the <code>let mut guess = String::new();</code> line has created a mutable variable that is currently bound to a new,
empty instance of a <code>String</code>.</p>
<h3 id="receiving-user-input"><a class="header" href="#receiving-user-input">Receiving User Input</a></h3>
<p>Recall that we included the input/output functionality from the standard library with <code>use std::io;</code> on the first line
of the program. Now we'll call the <code>stdin</code> function from the <code>io</code> module, which will allow us to handle user input:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    let mut guess = String::new();
</span><span class="boring">
</span>    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
<span class="boring">        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>If we hadn't imported the <code>io</code> library with <code>use std::io;</code> at the beginning of the program, we could still use the
function by writing this function call as <code>std::io::stdin</code>. The <code>stdin</code> function returns an instance
of <code>std::io::Stdin</code>, which is a type that represents a handle to the standard input for your terminal.</p>
<p>Next, the line <code>.read_line(&amp;mut guess)</code> calls the <code>read_line</code> method on the standard input handle to get input from the user. We're also passing <code>&amp;mut guess</code> as the argument to <code>read_line</code> to tell it what string to store the user input in. The full job of <code>read_line</code> is to take whatever the user types into standard input and append that into a string (without overwriting its contents), so we therefore pass that string as an argument. The string argument needs to be mutable so the method can change the string's content.</p>
<p>The <code>&amp;</code> indicates that this argument is a reference, which gives you a way to let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to copy that data into memory multiple times. References are a complex feature, and one of Rust's major advantages is how safe and easy it is to use references. You don't need to know a lot of those details to finish this program. For now, all we need to know is that, like variables, references are immutable by default. Hence, we need to write <code>&amp;mut guess</code> rather than <code>&amp;guess</code> to make it mutable.</p>
<h3 id="handling-potential-failure-with-result"><a class="header" href="#handling-potential-failure-with-result">Handling Potential Failure with Result</a></h3>

<p><code>read_line</code> puts whatever the user enters into the string we pass to it, but it also returns a <code>Result</code> value. <code>Result</code> is an enumeration, often called an <code>enum</code>, which is a type that can be in one of multiple possible states. We call each possible state a variant.</p>
<p>The purpose of these <code>Result</code> type is to encode error-handling information.</p>
<p><code>Result</code>'s variants are <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code>. The <code>Ok</code> variant indicates the operation was successful, and inside <code>Ok</code> is the successfully generated value. The <code>Err</code> variant means the operation failed, and <code>Err</code> contains information about how or why the operation failed.</p>
<p>Values of the <code>Result</code> type, like values of any type, have methods defined on them. An instance of <code>Result</code> has an <code>expect</code> method that you can call. If this instance of <code>Result</code> is an <code>Err</code> value, <code>expect</code> will cause the program to crash and display the message that you passed as an argument to <code>expect</code>. If the <code>read_line</code> method returns an <code>Err</code>, it would likely be the result of an error coming from the underlying operating system. If this instance of <code>Result</code> is an <code>Ok</code> value, <code>expect</code> will take the return value that <code>Ok</code> is holding and return just that value to you so you can use it. In this case, that value is the number of bytes in the user's input.</p>
<p>If you don't call <code>expect</code>, the program will compile, but you'll get a warning:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build

<p>Rust warns that you haven't used the <code>Result</code> value returned from <code>read_line</code>, indicating that the program hasn't handled a possible error.</p>
<p>The right way to suppress the warning is to actually write error-handling code, but in our case we just want to crash this program when a problem occurs, so we can use <code>expect</code>.</p>

<p>This line prints the string that now contains the user's input. The <code>{}</code> set of curly brackets is a placeholder: think of <code>{}</code> as little crab pincers that hold a value in place. When printing the value of a variable, the variable name can go inside the curly brackets. When printing the result of evaluating an expression, place empty curly brackets in the format string, then follow the format string with a comma-separated list of expressions to print in each empty curly bracket placeholder in the same order.

<h2 id="generating-a-secret-number"><a class="header" href="#generating-a-secret-number">Generating a Secret Number</a></h2>
<p>Next, we need to generate a secret number that the user will try to guess. We'll use a random number between 1 and 100. Rust doesn't yet include random number functionality in its standard library. However, the Rust team does provide a <code>rand</code> crate at https://crates.io/crates/rand with said functionality.</p>
<h3 id="using-a-crate-to-get-more-functionality"><a class="header" href="#using-a-crate-to-get-more-functionality">Using a Crate to Get More Functionality</a></h3>
<p>Remember that a crate is a collection of Rust source code files. The project we've been building is a binary crate, which is an executable. The <code>rand</code> crate is a library crate, which contains code that is intended to be used in other programs and can't be executed on its own.</p>
<p>Cargo's coordination of external crates is where Cargo really shines. Before we can write code that uses <code>rand</code>, we need to modify the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file to include the <code>rand</code> crate as a dependency. Open that file now and add the following line to the bottom, beneath the <code>[dependencies]</code> section header that Cargo created for you. Be sure to specify <code>rand</code> exactly as we have here, with this version number, or the code examples in this tutorial may not work.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
rand = &quot;0.8.5&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file, everything that follows a header is part of that section that continues until another section starts. In <code>[dependencies]</code> you tell Cargo which external crates your project depends on and which versions of those crates you require. In this case, we specify the <code>rand</code> crate with the semantic version specifier <code>0.8.5</code>. Cargo understands Semantic Versioning(sometimes called SemVer), which is a standard for writing version numbers. The specifier <code>0.8.5</code> is actually shorthand for <code>^0.8.5</code>, which means any version that is at least 0.8.5 but below 0.9.0.</p>
<p>Cargo considers these versions to have public APIs compatible with version 0.8.5, and this specification ensures you'll get the latest patch release that will still compile with the code in this chapter.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build

</code></pre>
<p>When we include an external dependency, Cargo fetches the latest versions of everything that dependency needs from the registry, which is a copy of data from Crates.io at https://crates.io. Crates.io is where people in the Rust ecosystem post their open source Rust projects for others to use.</p>
<p>After updating the registry, Cargo checks the <code>[dependencies]</code> section and downloads any crates listed that aren't already downloaded. In this case, although we only listed <code>rand</code> as a dependency, Cargo also grabbed other crates that <code>rand</code> depends on to work. After downloading the crates, Rust compiles them and then compiles the project with the dependencies available.</p>
<p>If you immediately run <code>cargo build</code> again without making any changes, you won't get any output aside from the <code>Finished</code> line. Cargo knows it has already downloaded and compiled the dependencies, and you haven't changed anything about them in your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file. Cargo also knows that you haven't changed anything about your code, so it doesn't recompile that either. With nothing to do, it simply exits.</p>
<h4 id="ensuring-reproducible-builds-with-the-cargolock-file"><a class="header" href="#ensuring-reproducible-builds-with-the-cargolock-file">Ensuring Reproducible Builds with the Cargo.lock File</a></h4>
<p>Cargo has a mechanism that ensures you can rebuild the same artifact every time you or anyone else builds your code: Cargo will use only the versions of the dependencies you specified until you indicate otherwise. For example, say that next week version 0.8.6 of the <code>rand</code> crate comes out, and that version contains an important bug fix, but it also contains a regression that will break your code. To handle this, Rust creates the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file the first time you run <code>cargo build</code>, so we now have this in the <code>guessing_game</code> directory.</p>
<p>When you build a project for the first time, Cargo figures out all the versions of the dependencies that fit the criteria and then writes them to the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file. When you build your project in the future, Cargo will see that the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file exists and will use the versions specified there rather than doing all the work of figuring out versions again. This lets you have a reproducible build automatically. In other words, your project will remain at 0.8.5 until you explicitly upgrade, thanks to the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file. Because the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file is important for reproducible builds, it's often checked into source control with the rest of the code in your project.</p>
<h4 id="updating-a-crate-to-get-a-new-version"><a class="header" href="#updating-a-crate-to-get-a-new-version">Updating a Crate to Get a New Version</a></h4>
<p>When you do want to update a crate, Cargo provides the command <code>update</code>, which will ignore the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file and figure out all the latest versions that fit your specifications in <code>Cargo.toml</code>. Cargo will then write those versions to the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file. Otherwise, by default, Cargo will only look for versions greater than 0.8.5 and less than 0.9.0.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to say about Cargo and its ecosystem, which we'll discuss in Chapter 14, but for now, that's all we need to know. Cargo makes it very easy to reuse libraries, so Rustaceans are able to write smaller projects that are assembled from a number of packages.</p>

<p>First we add the line <code>use rand::Rng;</code>(1).
The <code>Rng</code> trait defines methods that random number generators implement,
and this trait must be in scope for ust to use those methods.
Chapter 10 will cover traits in detail.</p>
<p>Next, we're adding two lines in the middle.
In the first line (2),
we call the <code>rand::thread_rng</code> function that gives us the particular random number generator we're going to use:
one that is local to the current thread of execution and is seeded by the operating system.
Then we call the <code>gen_range</code> method on the random number generator.
This method is defined by the <code>Rng</code> trait that we brought into scope with the <code>use rand::Rng;</code> statement.
The <code>gen_range</code> method takes a range expression as an argument and generates a random number in the rage.
The kind of range expression we're using here takes the from
<code>start..=end</code> and is inclusive on the lower and upper bounds,
so we need to specify <code>1..=100</code> to request a number between 1 and 100.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You won't just know which traits to use and which methods and functions to call from a crate, so each crate has documentation with instructions for using it. Another neat feature of Cargo is that running the <code>cargo doc --open</code> command will build documentation provided by all your dependencies locally and open it in your browser. If you're interested in other functionality in the <code>rand</code> crate, for example, run <code>cargo doc --open</code> and click <code>rand</code> in the sidebar on the left.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second new line (3) prints the secret number.
This is useful while we're developing the program to be able to test it, but we'll delete it from the final version.
It's not much of a game if the program prints the answer as soon as it starts!</p>

<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>First we add another <code>use</code> statement (1),
bringing a type called <code>std::cmp::Ordering</code> into scope from the standard library.
The <code>Ordering</code> type is another enum and has the variants <code>Less</code>, <code>Greater</code>, and <code>Equal</code>.
These are the three outcomes that are possible when you compare two values.</p>
<p>Then we add five new lines at the bottom that use the <code>Ordering</code> type.
The <code>cmp</code> method (3) compares two values and can be called on anything that can be compared.
It takes a reference to whatever you want to compare with: here it's comparing <code>guess</code> to <code>secret_number</code>.
Then it returns a variant of the <code>Ordering</code> enum we brought into scope with the <code>use</code> statement.
We use a <code>match</code> expression (2)
to decide what to do next based on which variant of <code>Ordering</code> was returned from the call to <code>cmp</code> with the values in <code>guess</code> and <code>secret_number</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>match</code> expression is made up of arms.
An arm consists of a pattern to match against,
and the code that should be run if the value given to <code>match</code> fits that arm's pattern.
Rust takes the value given to <code>match</code> and looks through each arm's pattern in turn.
Patterns and the <code>match</code> construct are powerful Rust features:
they let you express a variety of situations your code might encounter and they make sure you handle them all.
These features will be covered in detail in Chapter 6 and Chapter 18, respectively.</p>
<p>Let's walk through an example with the <code>match</code> expression we use here. Say that the user has guessed 50 and the randomly generated secret number this time is 38.</p>
<p>When the code compares 50 to 38, the <code>cmp</code> method will return <code>Ordering::Greater</code> because 50 is greater than 38. The <code>match</code> expression gets the <code>Ordering::Greater</code> value and starts checking each arm's pattern. It looks at the first arm's pattern, <code>Ordering::Less</code>, and sees that the value <code>Ordering::Greater</code> does not match <code>Ordering::Less</code>, so it ignores the code in that arm and moves to the next arm. The next arm's pattern is <code>Ordering::Greater</code>, which does match <code>Ordering::Greater</code>! The associated code in that arm will execute and print <code>Too big!</code> to the screen. The <code>match</code> expression ends after the first successful match, so it won't look at the last arm in this scenario. However, the code won't compile yet.</p>

error: could not compile `guessing_game` due to previous error
</code></pre>
<p>The core of the error states that there are mismatched types. Rust has a strong, static type system. However, it also has type inference. When we wrote <code>let mut guess = String::new()</code>, Rust was able to infer that <code>guess</code> should be a <code>String</code> and didn't make us write the type. The <code>secret_number</code>, on the other hand, is a number type. A few of Rust's number types can have a value between 1 and 100: <code>i32</code>, a 32-bit number; <code>u32</code>, an unsigned 32-bit number; <code>i64</code>, a 64-bit number; as well as others. Unless otherwise specified, Rust defaults to an <code>i32</code>, which is the type of <code>secret_number</code> unless you add type information elsewhere that would cause Rust to infer a different numerical type. The reason for the error is that Rust cannot compare a string and a number type.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we want to convert the <code>String</code> the program reads as input into a real number type so we can compare it numerically to the secret number. We do so by adding this line to the <code>main</code> function body:</p>

<p>We create a variable named <code>guess</code>. But wait, doesn't the program already have a variable named <code>guess</code>? It does but helpfully Rust allows us to shadow the previous value of <code>guess</code> with a new one. Shadowing lets us reuse the <code>guess</code> variable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables, such as <code>guess_str</code> and <code>guess</code>, for example. We'll cover this in more detail in Chapter 3, but for now, know that this feature is often used when you want to conver a value from one type to another type.</p>
<p>We bind this new variable to the expression <code>guess.trim().parse()</code>. The <code>guess</code> in the expression refers to the original <code>guess</code> variable that contained the input as a string. The <code>trim</code> method on a <code>String</code> instance will eliminate any whitespace at the beginning and end, which we must do to be able to compare the string to the <code>u32</code>, which can only contain numerical data. The user must press ENTER to satisfy <code>read_line</code> and input their guess, which adds a newline character to the string. For example, if the user types 5 and presses ENTER, <code>guess</code> looks like this: <code>5\n</code>. The <code>\n</code> represents &quot;newline.&quot; (On Windows, pressing ENTER results in a carriage return and a newline, <code>\r\n</code>.) The <code>trim</code> method eliminates <code>\n</code> or <code>\r\n</code>, resulting in just 5.</p>
<p>The <code>parse</code> method on strings converts a string to another type. Here, we use it to convert from a string to a number. We need to tell Rust the exact number type we want by using <code>let guess: u32</code>. The colon (<code>:</code>) after <code>guess</code> tells Rust we'll annotate the variable's type. Rust has a few built-in number types; the <code>u32</code> seen here is an unsigned, 32-bit integer. It's a good default choice for a small positive number. You'll learn about other number types in Chapter 3.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <code>u32</code> annotation in this example program and the comparison with <code>secret_number</code> means Rust will infer that <code>secret_number</code> should be a <code>u32</code> as well. So now the comparison will be between two values of the same type!</p>
<p>The <code>parse</code> method will only work on characters that can logically be converted into numbers and so can easily cause errors. If, for example, the string contained <code>A👍%</code>, there would be no way to convert that to a number. Because it might fail, the <code>parse</code> method returns a <code>Result</code> type, much as the <code>read_line</code> method does (discussed earlier in &quot;Handling Potential Failure with Result&quot;). We'll treat this <code>Result</code> the same way by using the <code>expect</code> method again. If <code>parse</code> returns an <code>Err Result</code> variant because it couldn't create a number from the string, the <code>expect</code> call will crash the game and print the message we give it. If <code>parse</code> can successfully convert the string to a number, it will return the <code>Ok</code> variant of <code>Result</code>, and <code>expect</code> will return the number that we want from the <code>Ok</code> value.</p>

<p>Nice! Even though spaces were added before the guess, the program still figured out that the user guessed 77.

<p>As you can see, we've moved everything from the guess input prompt onward into a loop.
Be sure to indent the lines inside the loop another four spaces each and run the program again. The program will now ask for another guess forever, which actually introduces a new problem.
It doesn't seem like the user can quit!</p>
<p>The user could always interrupt the program by using the keyboard shortcut CTRL-C. But there's another way to escape this insatiable monster as mentioned in the <code>parse</code> discussion in &quot;Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number&quot;: if the user enters a non-number answer, the program will crash. We can take advantage of that to allow the user to quit, as shown here:</p>

<p>We switch from an <code>expect</code> call to a <code>match</code> expression to move from crashing on an error to handling the error. Remember that <code>parse</code> returns a <code>Result</code> type and <code>Result</code> is an enum that has the variants <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code>. We're using a <code>match</code> expression here, as we did with the <code>Ordering</code> result of the <code>cmp</code> method.</p>
<p>If <code>parse</code> is able to successfully turn the string into a number, it will return an <code>Ok</code> value that contains the resultant number. That <code>Ok</code> value will match the first arm's pattern, and the <code>match</code> expression will just return the <code>num</code> value that <code>parse</code> produced and put inside the <code>Ok</code> value. That number will end up right where we want it in the new <code>guess</code> variable we're creating.</p>
<p>If <code>parse</code> is not able to turn the string into a number, it will return an <code>Err</code> value that contains more information about the error. The <code>Err</code> value does not match the <code>Ok(num)</code> pattern in the first <code>match</code> arm, but it does match the <code>Err(_)</code> pattern in the second arm. The underscore, <code>_</code>, is a catch-all value; in this example, we're saying we want to match all <code>Err</code> values, no matter what information they have inside them. So the program will execute the second arm's code, <code>continue</code>, which tells the program to go to the next iteration of the <code>loop</code> and ask for another guess. So, effectively, the program ignores all errors that <code>parse</code> might encounter!</p>

<p>Awesome! With one tiny final tweak, we will finight the guessing game.
Recall that the program is still printing the secret number. That worked well for testing, but it ruins the game. Let's delete the <code>println!</code> that outputs the secret number.</p>
<p>final code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use rand::Rng;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);

    loop {
        println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);

        let mut guess = String::new();

        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
            .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);

        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) =&gt; num,
            Err(_) =&gt; continue,
        };

        println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);

        match guess.cmp(&amp;secret_number) {

            Ordering::Greater =&gt; println!(&quot;Too big!&quot;),
            Ordering::Equal =&gt; {
                println!(&quot;You win!&quot;);

<h2 id="summary-1"><a class="header" href="#summary-1">Summary</a></h2>
<p>This project was a hands-on way to introduce you to many new Rust concepts: <code>let</code>, <code>match</code>, functions, the use of external crates, and more. In the next few chapters, you'll learn about these concepts in more detail. Chapter 3 covers concepts that most programming languages have, such as variables, data types, and functions, and shows how to use them in Rust. Chapter 4 explores ownership, a feature that makes Rust different from other languages. Chapter 5 discusses structs and method syntax, and Chapter 6 explains how enums work.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="common-programming-concepts"><a class="header" href="#common-programming-concepts">Common Programming Concepts</a></h1>
<p>This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming language and how they work in Rust.
Many programming languages have much in common at their core.
None of the concepts presented in this chapter are unique to Rust, but we'll discuss them in the context of Rust and
explain the conventions around using these concepts.</p>
<p>Specifically, you'll learn about variables, basic types, functions, comments, and control flow.
These foundations will be in every Rust program, and learning them early will give you a strong core to start from.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="keywords"><a class="header" href="#keywords">Keywords</a></h4>
<p>The Rust language has a set of keywords that are reserved for use by the language only, much as in other languages.
Keep in mind that you cannot use these words as names of variables or functions. Most of the keywords have special
meanings, and you'll be using them to do various tasks in your Rst programs; a few have no current functionality
associated with them but have been reserved for functionality that might be added to Rust in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="variables-and-mutability"><a class="header" href="#variables-and-mutability">Variables and Mutability</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned in &quot;Storing Values with Variables&quot;, by default, variables are immutable. This is one of many nudges Rust
gives you to write your code in a way that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that Rust offers. However,
you still have the option to make your variables mutable. Let's explore how and why Rust encourages you to favor
immutability and why sometimes you might want to opt out.</p>
<p>When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can't change that value. To illustrate this, generate
a new project called variables in your projects directory by using <code>cargo new variables</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
    x = 6;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Save and run the program using <code>cargo run</code>. You should receive an error message regarding an immutability error, as
shown in this output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
 --&gt; src\main.rs:4:5
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         -
  |         |
  |         first assignment to `x`
  |         help: consider making this binding mutable: `mut x`
3 |     println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
4 |     x = 6;
  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
</code></pre>
<p>This example shows how the compiler helps you find errors in your programs. Compiler errors can be frustrating, but
really they only mean your program isn't safely doing what you want it to do yet; they do not mean that you're not a
good programmer! Experienced Rustaceans still get compiler errors.</p>
<p>You received the error message <code>cannot assign twice to immutable variable 'x'</code> because you tried to assign a second
value to the immutable <code>x</code> variable. It's important that we get compile-time errors when we attempt to change a value
that's designated as immutable because this very situation can lead to bugs. If one part of our code operates on the
assumption that a value will never change and another part of our code changes that value, it's possible that the first
part of the code won't do what it was designed to do. The cause of this kind of bug can be difficult to track down after
the fact, especially when the second piece of code changes the value only sometimes. The Rust compiler guarantees that
when you state that a value won't change, it really won't change, so you don't have to keep track of it yourself. Your
code is thus easier to reason through.</p>
<p>But mutability can be very useful, and can make code more convenient to write. Although variables are immutable by
default, you can make them mutable by adding <code>mut</code> in front of the variable name as you did in Chapter 2.</p>
<p>Adding <code>mut</code> also conveys intent to future readers of the code by indicating that other parts of the code will be
changing this variable's value.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
    x = 6;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We're allowed to change the value bound to <code>x</code> from 5 to 6 when <code>mut</code> is used. Ultimately, deciding whether to use
mutability or ot is up to you and depends on what you think is clearest in that particular situation.</p>
<h3 id="constants"><a class="header" href="#constants">Constants</a></h3>
<p>Like immutable variables, constants are values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change, but there are a
few differences between constants and variables.</p>
<p>First, you aren't allowed to use <code>mut</code> with constants. Constants aren't just immutable by default — they're always
immutable. You declare constants using the <code>const</code> keyword instead of the <code>let</code> keyword, and the type of the value must
be annotated. We'll cover types and type annotations in &quot;Data Types&quot; soon. Just know that you must always annotate the
type.</p>
<p>Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes them useful for values that many parts
of code need to know about.</p>
<p>The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could
only be computed at runtime.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a constant declaration:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The constant's name is <code>THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS</code> and its value is set to the result of multiplying 60 (the number of
seconds in a minute) by 60 (the number of minutes in an hour) by 3 (the number of hours we want to count in this
program). Rust's naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words. The compiler is
able to evaluate a limited set of operations at compile time, which lets us choose to write out this value in a way
that's easier to understand and verify, rather than setting this constant to the value 10,800.
See the Rust Reference's section on constant evaluation at (https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/const_eval.html) for
more information on what operations can be used when declaring constants.</p>
<p>Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope in which they were declared. This property
makes constants useful for values in your application domain that multiple parts of the program might need to know
about, such as the maximum number of points any player of a game is allowed to earn, or the speed of light.</p>
<p>Naming hardcoded values used throughout your program as constants is useful in conveying the meaning of that value to
future maintainers of the code. It also helps to have only one place in your code you would need to change if the
hardcoded value needed to be updated in the future.</p>
<h3 id="shadowing"><a class="header" href="#shadowing">Shadowing</a></h3>
<p>As you saw in the guessing game tutorial in Chapter 2, you can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous
variable. Rustaceans say that the first variable is shadowed by the second, which means that the second variable is what
the compiler will see when you use the name of the variable. In effect, the second variable overshadows the first,
taking any uses of the variable name to itself until either it itself is shadowed or the scope ends. We can shadow a
variable by using the same variable's name and repeating the use of the <code>let</code> keyword as follows:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!(&quot;The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}&quot;);
    }

    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This program first binds <code>x</code> to a value of 5. Then it creates a new variable <code>x</code> by repeating <code>let x =</code>, taking the
original value and adding 1 so the value of <code>x</code> is then 6. Then within an inner scope created with the curly brackets,
the third <code>let statement also shadows </code>x<code>and creates a new variable, multiplying the previous value by 2 to give</code>
x<code>a value of 12. When that scope is over, the inner shadowing ends and</code>x` returns to being 6. When we run this
program, it will output the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
   Compiling shadowing v0.1.0 (C:\Users\jerok\projects\study_blog\rust_lang_book\code\ch03\shadowing)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.38s                                                            
     Running `target\debug\shadowing.exe`
The value of x in the inner scope is: 12
The value of x is: 6
</code></pre>
<p>Shadowing is different from marking a variable as <code>mut</code> because we'll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to
reassign to this variable without using the <code>let</code> keyword. By using <code>let</code>, we can perform a few transformations on a
value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.</p>
<p>The other difference between <code>mut</code> and shadowing is that because we're effectively creating a new variable when we use
the <code>let</code> keyword again, we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name. For example, say our program asks
a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by inputting space characters, and then we want to store that
input as a number:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let spaces = &quot;   &quot;;
    let spaces = spaces.len();
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>The first <code>spaces</code> variable is a string type and the second <code>spaces</code> variable is a number type. Shadowing thus spares us
from having to come up with different names, such as <code>spaces_str</code> and <code>spaces_num</code>; instead, we can reuse the
simpler <code>spaces</code> name. However, if we try to use <code>mut</code> for this, as shown here, we'll get a compile-time error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut spaces = &quot;   &quot;;
    spaces = spaces.len();
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>The error says we're not allowed to mutate a variable's type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --&gt; src\main.rs:15:14
   |
14 |     let mut spaces = &quot;   &quot;;
   |                      ----- expected due to this value
15 |     spaces = spaces.len();
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `&amp;str`, found `usize`
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we've explored how variables work, lt's look at more data types they can have.</p>
<h2 id="data-types"><a class="header" href="#data-types">Data Types</a></h2>
<p>Every value in Rust is of a certain data type, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to
work with that data. We'll look at two data type subsets: scalar and compound.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Rust is statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile
time. The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it. In cases when many
types are possible, such as when we converted a <code>String</code> to a numeric type using <code>parse</code> in &quot;Comparing the Guess to the
Secret Number&quot;, we must add a type annotation, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let guess: u32 = &quot;42&quot;.parse().expect(&quot;Not a number!&quot;);</code></pre>
<p>If we don't add the <code>: u32</code> type annotation shown in the preceiding code, Rust will display the following error, which
means the compiler needs more information from us to know which type we want to use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0282]: type annotations needed
 --&gt; src\main.rs:2:9
  |
2 |     let guess = &quot;42&quot;.parse().expect(&quot;Not a number!&quot;);
  |         ^^^^^
  |
help: consider giving `guess` an explicit type
  |
2 |     let guess: _ = &quot;42&quot;.parse().expect(&quot;Not a number!&quot;);
  |              +++
</code></pre>
<p>You'll see different type annotations for other data types.</p>
<h3 id="scalar-types"><a class="header" href="#scalar-types">Scalar Types</a></h3>
<p>A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans,
and characters. You may recognize these from other programming languages. Let's jump into how they work in Rust.</p>
<h4 id="integer-types"><a class="header" href="#integer-types">Integer Types</a></h4>
<p>An integer is a number without a fractional component. We used one integer type in Chapter 2, the <code>u32</code> type. This type
declaration indicates that the value it's associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types starts
with <code>i</code> instead of <code>u</code>) that takes up 32 bits of space. Table shows the built-in integer types is Rust. We can use any
of these variants to declare the type of an integer value.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Length</th><th>Signed</th><th>Unsigned</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>8-bit</td><td><code>i8</code></td><td><code>u8</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>16-bit</td><td><code>i16</code></td><td><code>u16</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>32-bit</td><td><code>i32</code></td><td><code>u32</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>64-bit</td><td><code>i64</code></td><td><code>u64</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>128-bit</td><td><code>i128</code></td><td><code>u128</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>arch</td><td><code>isize</code></td><td><code>usize</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size. Signed and unsigned refer to whether it's
possible for the number to be negative - in other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it (signed) or
whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be represented without a sign (unsigned). It's like writing
numbers on paper: when the sign matters, a number is shown with a plus sign or a minus sign; however, when it's safe to
assume the number is positive, it's shown with no sign. Signed numbers are stored using two's complement representation.</p>
<p>Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2<sup>n-1</sup>) to 2<sup>n-1</sup>-1 inclusive, where n is the number of
bits that variant uses. So an <code>i8</code> can store numbers from -(2<sup>7</sup>) to 2<sup>7</sup>-1, which equals -128 to 127.
Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup>-1, so a <code>u8</code> can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>8</sup>-1,
which equals 0 to 255.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <code>isize</code> and <code>usize</code> types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on, which
is denoted in the table as &quot;arch&quot;: 64 bits if you're on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you're on a 32-bit
architecture.</p>
<p>You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in the Table. Note that number literals that can be multiple
numeric types allow a type suffix, such as <code>57u8</code>, to designate the type. Number literals can also use <code>_</code> as a visual
separator to make the number easier to read, such as <code>1_000</code>, which will have the same value as if you had
specified <code>1000</code>.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Number literals</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Decimal</td><td>98_222</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hex</td><td>0xff</td></tr>
<tr><td>Octal</td><td>0o77</td></tr>
<tr><td>Binary</td><td>0b1111_0000</td></tr>
<tr><td>Byte (<code>u8</code> only)</td><td>b'A'</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>So how do you know which type of integer to use? If you're unsure, Rust's defaults are generally good places to start:
integer types default to <code>i32</code>. The primary situation in which you'd use <code>isize</code> or <code>usize</code> is when indexing some sort
of collection.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="integer-overflow"><a class="header" href="#integer-overflow">Integer Overflow</a></h4>
<p>Let's say you have a variable of type <code>u8</code> that can hold values between 0 and 255. If you try to change the variable
to a value outside that range, such as 256, integer overflow will occur, which can result in one of two behaviors.
When
you're compiling in debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow that cause your program to panic at runtime
if
this behavior occurs. Rust uses the term panicking when a program exits with an error; we'll discuss panics in more
depth in &quot;Unrecoverable Errors with panic!&quot;.</p>
<p>When you're compiling in release mode with the <code>--release</code> flag, Rust does not include checks for integer overflow
that cause panics. Instead, if overflow occurs, Rust performs two's complement wrapping. In short, values greater than
the maximum value the type can hold &quot;wrap around&quot; to the minimum of the values the type can hold. In the case of
a <code>u8</code>,
the value 256 becomes 0, the value 257 becomes 1, and so on. The program won't panic, but the variable will have a
value
that probably isn't what you were expecting it to have. Relying on integer overflow's wrapping behavior is considered
an
error.</p>
<p>To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use these families of methods provided by the standard
library for primitive numeric types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrap in all modes with the <code>wrapping_*</code> methods, such as <code>wrapping_add</code>.</li>
<li>Return the <code>None</code> value if there is overflow with the <code>checked_*</code> methods.</li>
<li>Return the value and a Boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the <code>overflowing_*</code> methods.</li>
<li>Saturate at the value's minimum or maximum values with the <code>saturating_*</code> methods.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="floating-point-types"><a class="header" href="#floating-point-types">Floating-Point Types</a></h4>
<p>Rust also has two primitive types for floating-point numbers, which are numbers with decimal points. Rust's
floating-point types are <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code>, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is <code>f64</code>
because on modern CPUs, it's roughly the same speed as <code>f32</code> but is capable of more precision. All floating-point types
are signed.</p>
<p>Here's an example that shows floating-point numbers in action:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let x = 2.0;  // f64
    
    let y: f32 = 3.0;  // f32
}</code></pre>
<p>Floating_point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The <code>f32</code> type is a single-precision float,
and <code>f64</code> has double precision.</p>
<h4 id="numeric-operations"><a class="header" href="#numeric-operations">Numeric Operations</a></h4>
<p>Rust supports the basic mathematical operations you'd expect for all the number types: addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and remainder. Integer division truncates toward zero to the nearest integer. The following
code shows how you'd use each numeric operation in a <code>let</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;
    
    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;
    
    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;
    
    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3;  // Results in -1
    
    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}</code></pre>
<p>Each expression in these statements uses a mathematical operator and evaluates to a single value, which is then bound to
a variable. Appendix B contains a list of all operators that Rust provides.</p>
<h4 id="the-boolean-type"><a class="header" href="#the-boolean-type">The Boolean Type</a></h4>
<p>As in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible values: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. Booleans are
one byte in size. The Boolean type in Rust is specified using <code>bool</code>. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let t = true;
    
    let f: bool = false;  // with explicit type annotation
}</code></pre>
<p>The main way to use Boolean values is through conditionals, such as an <code>if</code> expression. We'll cover how <code>if</code> expressions
work in Rust in &quot;Control Flow&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="the-character-type"><a class="header" href="#the-character-type">The Character Type</a></h4>
<p>Rust's <code>char</code> type is the language's most primitive alphabetic type. Here are some examples of declaring <code>char</code> values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = 'Z';  // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = '😻';
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that we specify <code>char</code> literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes.
Rust's <code>char</code> type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode scalar value, which means it can represent a lot more
than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all
valid <code>char</code> values in Rust. Unicode scalar values range from <code>U+0000</code> to <code>U+D7FF</code> and <code>U+E000</code> to <code>U+10FFFF</code> inclusive.
However, a &quot;character&quot; isn't really a concept in Unicode, so your haman intuition for what a &quot;character&quot; is may not
match up with what a <code>char</code> is in Rust. We'll discuss this topic in detail in &quot;Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="compound-types"><a class="header" href="#compound-types">Compound Types</a></h3>
<p>Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.</p>
<h4 id="the-tuple-type"><a class="header" href="#the-tuple-type">The Tuple Type</a></h4>
<p>A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples
have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.</p>
<p>We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type,
and the types of the different values in the tuple don't have to be the same. We've added optional type annotations in
this example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>tup</code> binds to the entire tuple because a tuple is considered a single compound element. To get the
individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
    
    let (x, y, z) = tup;
    
    println!(&quot;The value of y is: {y}&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<p>This program first creates a tuple and binds it to the variable <code>tup</code>. It then uses a pattern with <code>let</code> to take <code>tup</code>
and turn it into three separate variables, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>. This is called destructuring because it breaks the single
tuple into three parts. Finally, the program prints the value of <code>y</code>, which is 6.4.</p>
<p>We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (<code>.</code>) followed by the index of the value we want to
access. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    
    let five_hundred = x.0;
    let six_point_four = x.1;
    let one = x.2;
}</code></pre>
<p>This program creates the tuple <code>x</code> and then accesses each element of the tuple using their respective indices. As with
most programming languages, the first index in a tuple is 0.</p>
<p>The tuple without any values has a special name, unit. This value and its corresponding type are both written <code>()</code> and
represent an empty value or an empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don't return any
other value.</p>
<h4 id="the-array-type"><a class="header" href="#the-array-type">The Array Type</a></h4>
<p>Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an array. Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must
have the same type. Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.</p>
<p>We write the values in an array as a comma-separated list inside square brackets:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}</code></pre>
<p>Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap (we will discuss the stack and the
heap more in Chapter 4) or when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements. An array isn't as
flexible as the vector type, though. A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that is
allowed to grow or shrink in size. If you're unsure whether to use an array or a vector, chances are you should use a
vector. Chapter 8 discusses vectors in more detail.</p>
<p>However, arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements will not need to change. For example, if you were
using the names of the month in the program, you would probably use an array rather than a vector because you know it
will always contain 12 elements:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let months = [&quot;January&quot;, &quot;February&quot;, &quot;March&quot;, &quot;April&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;June&quot;, &quot;July&quot;,
&quot;August&quot;, &quot;September&quot;, &quot;October&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;December&quot;];</code></pre>
<p>You write an array's type using square brackets with the type of each element, a semicolon, and then the number of
elements in the array, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>i32</code> is the type of each element. After the semicolon, the number 5 indicates the array contains five elements.</p>
<p>You can also initialize an array to contain the same value for each element by specifying the initial value, followed by
a semicolon, and then the length of the array in square brackets, as shown here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let a = [3; 5];</code></pre>
<p>The array named <code>a</code> will contain 5 elements that will all be set to the value 3 initially. This is the same as
writing <code>let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];</code> but in a more concise way.</p>
<h4 id="accessing-array-elements"><a class="header" href="#accessing-array-elements">Accessing Array Elements</a></h4>
<p>An array is a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can be allocated on the stack. You can access elements
of an array using indexing, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the variable named <code>first</code> will get the value 1 because that is the value at index <code>[0]</code> in the array.
The variable named <code>second</code> will get the value 2 from index <code>[1]</code> in the array.</p>
<h4 id="invalid-array-element-access"><a class="header" href="#invalid-array-element-access">Invalid Array Element Access</a></h4>
<p>Let's see what happens if you try to access an element of an array that is past the end of the array. Say you run this
code, similar to the guessing game in Chapter 2, to get an array index from the user:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">use std::io;

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    println!(&quot;Please enter an array index.&quot;);

    let mut index = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut index)
        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);

    let index: usize = index
        .trim()
        .parse()
        .expect(&quot;Index entered was not a number&quot;);

    let element = a[index];

    println!(
        &quot;The value of the element at index {index} is: {element}&quot;
    );
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This code compiles successfully. If you run this code using <code>cargo run</code> and enter 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, the program will
print out the corresponding value at that index in the array. If you instead enter a number past the end of the array,
such as 10, you'll see output like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10', src\main.rs:19:19
note: Some details are omitted, run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` for a verbose backtrace.
</code></pre>
<p>The program resulted in a runtime error at the point of using an invalid value in the indexing operation. The program
exited with an error message and didn't execute the final <code>println!</code> statement. When you attempt to access an element
using indexing, Rust will check that the index you've specified is less than the array length. If the index is greater
than or equal to the length, Rust will panic. This check has to happen at runtime, especially in this case, because the
compiler can't possibly know what value a user will enter when they run the code later.</p>
<p>This is an example of Rust's memory safety principles in action. In many low-level languages, this kind of check is not
done, and when you provide an incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed. Rust protects you against this kind of
error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory access and continuing. Chapter 9 discusses more of Rust's
error handling and how you can write readable, safe code that neither panics nor allows invalid memory access.</p>
<h2 id="functions"><a class="header" href="#functions">Functions</a></h2>
<p>Functions are prevalent in Rust code. You've already seen one of the most important functions in the language:
the <code>main</code> function, which is the entry point of many programs. You've also seen the <code>fn</code> keyword, which allows you to
declare new functions.</p>
<p>Rust code uses snake case as the conventional style for function and variable names, in which all letters are lowercase
and underscores separate words. Here's a program that contains an example function definition:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!(&quot;Another function&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We define a function in Rust by entering <code>fn</code> followed by a function name and a set of parentheses. The curly brackets
tell the compiler where the function body begins and ends.</p>
<p>We can call any function we've defined by entering its name followed by a set of parentheses. Because <code>another_function</code>
is defined in the program, it can be called from inside the <code>main</code> function. Note that we defined <code>another_function</code>
after the <code>main</code> function in the source code; we could have defined it before as well. Rust doesn't care where you
define your functions, only that they're defined somewhere in a scope that can be seen by the caller.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The lines execute in the order in which they appear in the <code>main</code> function. First the &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message prints,
and then <code>another_function</code> is called and its message is printed.</p>
<h3 id="parameters"><a class="header" href="#parameters">Parameters</a></h3>
<p>We can define functions to have parameters, which are special variables that are part of a function's signature. When a
function has parameters, you can provide it with concrete values for those parameters. Technically, the concrete values
are called arguments, but in casual conversion, people tend to use the words parameter and argument interchangeably for
either the variables in a function's definition or the concrete values passed in when you call a function.</p>
<p>In this version of <code>another_function</code> we add a parameter:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.08s
     Running `target\debug\functions.exe`
The value of x is: 5
</code></pre>
<p>The declaration of <code>another_function</code> has one parameter named <code>x</code>. The type of <code>x</code> is specified as <code>i32</code>. When we pass 5
in to <code>another_function</code>, the <code>println!</code> macro puts 5 where the pair of curly brackets containing <code>x</code> was in the format
string.</p>
<p>In function signatures, you must declare the type of each parameter. This is a deliberate decision in Rust's design:
requiring type annotations in function definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in
the code to figure out what type you mean. The compiler is also able to give more helpful error messages if it knows
what types the function expects.</p>
<p>When defining multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations with commas, like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    print_labeled_measurement(5, 'h');
}

fn print_labeled_measurement(value: i32, unit_label: char) {
    println!(&quot;The measurement is: {value}{unit_label}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This example creates a function named <code>print_labeled_measurement</code> with two parameters. The first parameter is
named <code>value</code> and is an <code>i32</code>. The second is named <code>unit_label</code> and is type <code>char</code>. The function then prints text
containing both the <code>value</code> and the <code>unit_label</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.09s
     Running `target\debug\functions.exe`
The measurement is: 5h
</code></pre>
<p>Because we called the function with 5 as the value for <code>value</code> and <code>h</code> as the value for <code>unit_label</code>, the program output
contains those values.</p>
<h3 id="statements-and-expressions"><a class="header" href="#statements-and-expressions">Statements and Expressions</a></h3>
<p>Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression. So far, the functions we've
covered haven't included an ending expression, but you have seen an expression as part of a statement. Because Rust is
an expression-based language, this is an important distinction to understand. Other languages don't have the same
distinctions, so let's look at what statements and expressions are and how their differences affect the bodies of
functions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.</li>
<li>Expressions evaluate to a resultant value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at some examples.</p>
<p>We've actually already used statements and expressions. Creating a variable and assigning a value to it with the <code>let</code>
keyword is a statement.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let y = 6;
}</code></pre>
<p>Function definitions are also statements; the entire preceding example is a statement in itself.</p>
<p>Statements do not return values. Therefore, you can't assign a <code>let</code> statement to another variable, as the following
code tries to do; you'll get an error:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let x = (let y = 6);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>When you run this program, the error you'll get looks like this:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The <code>let y = 6</code> statement does not return a value, so there isn't anything for <code>x</code> to bind to. This is different from
what happens in other languages, where the assignment returns the value of the assignment. In other languages, you can
write <code>x = y = 6</code> and have both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have the value 6; that is not the case in Rust.</p>
<p>Expressions evaluate to a value and make up most of the rest of the code that you'll write in Rust. Consider a math
operation, such as 5 + 6, which is an expression that evaluates to the value 11. Expressions can be part of statements:
the 6 in the statement <code>let y = 6;</code> is an expression that evaluates to the value 6. Calling a function is an expression.
Calling a macro is an expression. A new scope block created with curly brackets is an expression, for example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let y = {       // 1, 2
        let x = 3;
        x + 1       // 3
    };
    
    println!(&quot;The value of y is: {y}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The expression (2) is a block that, in this case, evaluates to 4. That value gets bound to <code>y</code> as part of the <code>let</code>
statement (1). Note the line without a semicolon at the end (3), which is unlike most of the lines you've seen so fat.
Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a
statement, and it will then not return a value. Keep this in mind as you explore function return values and expressions
next.</p>
<h3 id="functions-with-return-values"><a class="header" href="#functions-with-return-values">Functions with Return Values</a></h3>
<p>Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We don't name return values, but we must declare their type
after an arrow (<code>-&gt;</code>). In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in
the block of the body of a function. You can return early from a function by using the <code>return</code> keyword and specifying a
value, but most functions return the last expression implicitly. Here's an example of a function that returns a value:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn five() -&gt; i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();
    
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>There are no function calls, macros, or even <code>let</code> statements in the <code>five</code> function - just the number 5 by itself.
That's a perfectly valid function in Rust. Note that the function's return type is specified too, as <code>-&gt; i32</code>. Try
running this code; the output should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run

     Running `target\debug\functions.exe`
The value of x is: 5
</code></pre>
<p>The 5 in <code>five</code> is the function's return value, which is why the return type is <code>i32</code>. Let's examine this in more
detail. There are two important bits: first the line <code>let x = five();</code> shows that we're using the return values of a
function to initialize a variable. Because the function <code>five</code> returns a 5, that line is the same as the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let x = 5;</code></pre>
<p>Second, the <code>five</code> function has no parameters and defines the type of the return value, but the body of the functions is
a lonely 5 with no semicolon because it's an expression whose value we want to return.</p>
<p>Let's look at another example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    x + 1
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Running this code will printing <code>The value of x is: 6</code>. But if we place a semicolon at the end of the line
containing <code>x + 1</code>, changing it from an expression to a statement, we'll get an error:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);

<p>The main error message, <code>mismatched types</code>, reveals the core issue with this code. The definition of the
function <code>plus_one</code> says that it will return an <code>i32</code>, but statements don't evaluate to a value, which is expressed

which would fix the error.</p>
<h2 id="commnets"><a class="header" href="#commnets">Commnets</a></h2>
<p>All programmers strive to make their code easy to understand but sometimes extra explanation is warranted. In these
cases, programmers leave
comments in their source code that the compiler will ignore but people reading the source code may find useful.
Here’s a simple comment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">// hello, world</code></pre>
<p>In Rust, the idiomatic comment style starts a comment with two slashes,
and the comment continues until the end of the line. For comments that
extend beyond a single line, you’ll need to include <code>//</code> on each line, like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// So we're doing something complicated here, long enough that we need
// multiple lines of comments to do it! Whew! Hopefully, this comment will
// explain what's going on.
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Comments can also be placed at the end of lines containing code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let lucky_number = 7;  // I'm feeling lucky today
}</code></pre>
<p>But you’ll more often see them used in this format, with the comment
on a separate line above the code it’s annotating:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    // I'm feeling lucky today
    let lucky_number = 7;
}</code></pre>
<p>Rust also has another kind of comment, documentation comments,
which we’ll discuss in “Publishing a Crate to Crates.io”.</p>
<h2 id="control-flow"><a class="header" href="#control-flow">Control Flow</a></h2>
<p>The ability to run some code depending on whether a condition is <code>true</code> and
to run some code repeatedly while a condition is <code>true</code> are basic building
blocks in most programming languages. The most common constructs
that let you control the flow of execution of Rust code are <code>if</code> expressions
and loops.</p>
<h3 id="if-expressions"><a class="header" href="#if-expressions">if Expressions</a></h3>
<p>An <code>if</code> expression allows you to branch your code depending on conditions. You provide a condition and then state, &quot;If
this condition is met, run this block of code. If the condition is not met, do not run this block of code.&quot;</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number &lt; 5 {
        println!(&quot;condition was true&quot;);
    } else {
        println!(&quot;condition was false&quot;);
    }
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>All <code>if</code> expressions start with the keyword <code>if</code>, followed by a condition. In this case, the condition checks whether or
not the variable <code>number</code> has a value less than 5. We place the block of code execute if the condition is <code>true</code>
immediately after the condition inside curly brackets. Blocks of code associated with the conditions in <code>if</code> expressions
are sometimes called arms, just like the arms in <code>match</code> expressions that we discussed in  &quot;Comparing the GUess to the
Secret Number&quot;.</p>
<p>Optionally, we can also include an <code>else</code> expression, which we chose to do here, to give the program an alternative
block of code to execute should the condition evaluate to <code>false</code>. If you don't provide an <code>else</code> expression and the
condition is <code>false</code>, the program will just skip the <code>if</code> block and move on to the next bit of code.</p>
<p>Let's try changing the value of <code>number</code> to a value that makes the condition <code>false</code> to see what happens:</p>

<p>The error indicates that Rust expected a <code>bool</code> but got an integer. Unlike languages such as Ruby and JavaScript, Rust
will not automatically try to convert non-Boolean types to a Boolean. You must be explicit and always provide <code>if</code> with
a Boolean as its condition. If we want the <code>if</code> code block to run only when a number is not equal to 0, for example we
can change the <code>if</code> expression to the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {

<p>This program has four possible paths it can take. After running it, you should see the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run

number is divisible by 3
</code></pre>
<p>When this program executes, it checks each <code>if</code> expression in turn and executes the first body for which the condition
evaluates to <code>true</code>. Note that even though 6 is divisible by 2, we don't see the output <code>number is divisible by 2</code>, nor
do we see the <code>number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2</code> text from the <code>else</code> block. That's because Rust only executes the
block for the first <code>true</code> condition, and once it finds one, it doesn't even check the rest.</p>
<p>Using too many <code>else if</code> expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more than one, you might want to refactor
your code. Chapter 6 describes a powerful Rust branching construct called <code>match</code> for these cases.</p>

<p>Remember that blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them, and numbers by themselves are also expressions. In
this case, the value of the whole <code>if</code> expression depends on which block of code executes. This means the values that
have the potential to be results from each arm of the <code>if</code> must be the same type; the results of both the <code>if</code> arms and
the <code>else</code> arm were <code>i32</code> integers. If the types are mismatched, as in the following example, we'll get an error:</p>

<p>The expression in the <code>if</code> block evaluates to an integer, and the expression in the <code>else</code> block evaluates to a string.
This won't work because variables must have a single type, and Rust needs to know at compile time what type
the <code>number variable is, definitively. Knowing the type of </code>
number<code>lets the compiler verify the type is valid everywhere we use</code>
number<code>. Rust wouldn't be able to do that if the type of </code>number` was only determined at runtime; the compiler would be
more complex and would make fewer guarantees about the code if it had to keep track of multiple hypothetical types for
any variable.</p>
<h3 id="repetition-with-loops"><a class="header" href="#repetition-with-loops">Repetition with Loops</a></h3>
<p>It's often useful to execute a block of code more than once. For this task, Rust provides several loops, which will run
through the code inside the loop body to the end and then start immediately back at the beginning.</p>
<p>Rust has three kinds of loops: <code>loop</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>for</code>.</p>
<h4 id="repeating-code-with-loop"><a class="header" href="#repeating-code-with-loop">Repeating Code with loop</a></h4>
<p>The <code>loop</code> keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to
stop.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    loop {
        println!(&quot;again!&quot;);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>When we run this program, we'll see <code>again!</code> printed over and over continuously until we stop the program manually. Most
terminals support the keyboard shortcut CTRL-C to interrupt a program that is stuck in a continual loop.</p>
<p>Rust also provides a way to break out of a loop using code. You can place the <code>break</code> keyword within the loop to tell
the program when to stop executing the loop.</p>
<p>We also used <code>continue</code> in the guessing game, which in a loop tells the program to skip over any remaining code in this
iteration of the loop and go to the next iteration.</p>
<h4 id="returning-values-from-loops"><a class="header" href="#returning-values-from-loops">Returning Values from Loops</a></h4>
<p>One of the uses of a <code>loop</code> is to retry an operation you know might fail, such as checking whether a thread has
completed its job. You might also need to pass the result of that operation out of the loop to the rest of your code. To
do this, you can add the value you want returned after the <code>break</code> expression you use to stop the loop; that value will
be returned out of the loop so you can use it, as shown here:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!(&quot;The result is {result}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Before the loop, we declare a variable named <code>counter</code> and initialize it to 0. Then we declare a variable named <code>result</code>
to hold the value returned from the loop. On every iteration of the loop, we add 1 to the <code>counter</code> variable, and then
check whether the <code>counter</code> is equal to 10. When it is, we use the <code>break</code> keyword with the value <code>counter * 2</code>. After
the loop, we use a semicolon to end the statement that assigns the value to <code>result</code>. Finally, we print the value
in <code>result</code>, which in this case is 20.</p>
<h4 id="loop-labels-to-disambiguate-between-multiple-loops"><a class="header" href="#loop-labels-to-disambiguate-between-multiple-loops">Loop Labels to Disambiguate Between Multiple Loops</a></h4>
<p>If you have loops within loops, <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> apply to the innermost loop at that point. You can optionally
specify a loop label on a loop that you can then use with <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> to specify that those keywords apply to
the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop. Loop labels must begin with a single quote.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!(&quot;count = {count}&quot;);
        let mut remaining = 10;

        loop {
            println!(&quot;remaining = {remaining}&quot;);
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }

        count += 1;
    }
    println!(&quot;End count = {count}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.13s
     Running `target\debug\loops.exe`
count = 0
remaining = 10
remaining = 9
count = 1
remaining = 10
remaining = 9
count = 2
remaining = 10
End count = 2
</code></pre>
<p>Conditional Loops with while</p>
<p>A program will often need to evaluate a condition within a loop. While the condition is <code>true</code>, the loop runs. When the
condition ceases to be <code>true</code>, the program calls <code>break</code>, stopping the loop. It's possible to implement behavior like
this using a combination of <code>loop</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>break</code>; you could try that now in a program, if you'd like.
However, this pattern is so common that Rust has a built-in language construct for it, called a <code>while</code> loop.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!(&quot;{number}!&quot;);

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!(&quot;LIFTOFF!!!&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This construct eliminates a lot of nesting that would be necessary if you used <code>loop</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>break</code>, and
it's clearer. While a condition evaluates to <code>true</code>, the code runs; otherwise, it exits the loop.</p>
<h4 id="looping-through-a-collection-with-for"><a class="header" href="#looping-through-a-collection-with-for">Looping Through a Collection with for</a></h4>
<p>You can choose to use the <code>while</code> construct to loop over the elements of a collection, such as an array.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index &lt; 5 {
        println!(&quot;the value is: {}&quot;, a[index]);

        index += 1;
    }
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, the code counts up through the elements in the array. It starts at index 0, and then loops until it reaches the
final index in the array (that is, when <code>index &lt; 5</code> is no longer <code>true</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
   Compiling loops v0.1.0 (C:\Users\jerok\projects\study_blog\rust_lang_book\code\ch03\loops)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.60s                                             
     Running `target\debug\loops.exe`
the value is: 10
the value is: 20

</code></pre>
<p>All five array values appear in the terminal, as expected. Even though <code>index</code> will reach a value of 5 at some point,
the loop stops executing before trying to fetch a sixth value from the array.</p>
<p>However, this approach is error prone; we could cause the program to panic if the index value or test condition is
incorrect. For example, if you changed the definition of the <code>a</code> array to have four elements but forgot to update the
condition to <code>while index &lt; 4</code>, the code would panic. It's also slow, because the compiler adds runtime code to perform
the conditional check or whether the index is within the bounds of the array on every iteration through the loop.</p>
<p>As a more concise alternative, you can use a <code>for</code> loop and execute some code for each item in a collection.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!(&quot;the value is: {element}&quot;);
    }
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>When we run this code, we'll see the same output as previous example. More importantly, we've now increased the safety
of the code and eliminated the chance of bugs that might result from goint beyond the end of the array or not going far
enough and missing some items.</p>
<p>Using the <code>for</code> loop, you wouldn't need to remember to change any other code if you changed the number of values in the
array.</p>
<p>The safety and conciseness of <code>for</code> loops make them the most commonly used loop construct in Rust. Even in situations in
which you want to run some code a certain number of times, as in the countdown example that used a <code>while</code> loop, most
Rustaceans would use a <code>for</code> loop. The way to do that would be to use a <code>Range</code>, provided by the standard library, which
generates all numbers in sequence starting from one number and ending before another number.</p>
<p>Here's what the countdown would look like using a <code>for</code> loop and another method we've not yet talked about, <code>rev</code>, to
reverse the range:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!(&quot;{number}!&quot;);
    }
    println!(&quot;LIFTOFF!!!&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This code is a bit nicer, isn't it?</p>
<h2 id="summary-2"><a class="header" href="#summary-2">Summary</a></h2>
<p>You made it! This was a sizable chapter: you learned about variables, scalar and compound data types, functions,
comments, <code>if</code> expressions, and loops! To practice with the concepts discussed in this chapter, try building programs to
do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.</li>
<li>Generate the nth Fibonacci number.</li>
<li>Print the lyrics to the Christmas carol &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas,&quot; taking advantage of the repetition in the
song.</li>
</ul>
