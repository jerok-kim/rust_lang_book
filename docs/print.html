<p>Let's start our Rust jorney! There's a lot to learn, but every journey starts somewhere. In this chapter, we'll discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing Rust on Linux, macOS, and Windows</li>
<li>Writing a program that prints <code>Hello, world!</code></li>
<li>Using <code>cargo</code>, Rust's package manager and build system</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installiation"><a class="header" href="#installiation">Installiation</a></h2>
<p>The first step is to install Rust. We'll download Rust through <code>rustup</code>, command line tool for managing Rust versions
and associated tools.</p>
<p>The following steps install the latest stable version of the Rust compiler.
Rust's stability guarantees ensure that all the examples in the book that compile will continue to compile with newer
Rust versions.</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">$ rustup update
</code></pre>
<h3 id="local-documentation"><a class="header" href="#local-documentation">Local Documentation</a></h3>
<p>The installation of Rust also includes a local copy of the documentation so that you can read it offline.
Run <code>rustup doc</code> to open the local documentation in your browser.</p>
<p>Any time a type or function is provided by the standard library and you're not sure what it does or how to use it, use
the application programming interface (API) documentation to find out!</p>
<h2 id="hello-world"><a class="header" href="#hello-world">Hello, World!</a></h2>
<p>Now that you’ve installed Rust, it’s time to write your first Rust program.
It’s traditional when learning a new language to write a little program that
prints the text <code>Hello, world!</code> to the screen, so we’ll do the same here!</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-project-directory"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-project-directory">Creating a Project Directory</a></h3>
<p>You’ll start by making a directory to store your Rust code. It doesn’t matter to Rust where your code lives, but for the
exercises and projects in this book, we suggest making a projects directory in your home directory and keeping all your
projects there.
Open a terminal and enter the following commands to make a projects
directory and a directory for the “Hello, world!” project within the
projects directory.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world
</code></pre>
<h3 id="writing-and-running-a-rust-program"><a class="header" href="#writing-and-running-a-rust-program">Writing and Running a Rust Program</a></h3>
<p>Next, make a new source file and call it <code>main.rs</code>. Rust files always end with the <code>.rs</code> extension. If you're using more
than one word in your filename, the convention is to use an underscore to separate them. For example,
use <code>hello_world.rs</code> rather than <code>helloworld.rs</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>Hello, world!</code> did print, congratulations! You've officially written a Rust program. That makes you a Rust
programmer - welcome!</p>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-a-rust-program"><a class="header" href="#anatomy-of-a-rust-program">Anatomy of a Rust Program</a></h3>
<p>Let’s review this “Hello, world!” program in detail. Here’s the first piece of
the puzzle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
<span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
</span>}</code></pre>
<p>These lines define a function named <code>main</code>. The <code>main</code> function is special: it is always the first code that runs in
every executable Rust program. Here the first line declares a function named <code>main</code> that has no parameters and returns
nothing. If there were parameters, they would go inside the parentheses <code>()</code>.</p>
<p>The function body is wrapped in <code>{}</code>. Rust requires curly brackets around all function bodies. It's good style to place
the opening curly bracket on the same line as the function declaration, adding one space in between.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to stick to a standard style across Rust projects, you can use an automatic
formatter tool called rustfmt to format your code in a particular style (more on rustfmt
in Appendix D). The Rust team has included this tool with the standard Rust distribution, as rustc is, so it should
already be installed on your computer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The body of the <code>main</code> function hold the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>This line does all the work in this little program: it prints text to the screen. There are four important details to
notice here.</p>
<p>First, Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.</p>
<p>Second, <code>println!</code> calls a Rust macro. If it had called a function instead, it would be entered as <code>println</code>(without
the <code>!</code>). We'll discuss Rust macros in more detail in Chapter 19. For now, you just need to know that using a <code>!</code> means
that you're calling a macro instead of a normal function and that macros don't always follow the same rules as
functions.</p>
<p>Third, you see the <code>&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</code> string. We pass this string as an argument to <code>println!</code>, and the string is printed
to the screen.</p>
<p>Fourth, we end the line with a semicolon(<code>;</code>), which indicates that this expression is over and the next one is ready to
begin. Most lines of Rust code end with a semicolon.</p>
<h3 id="compiling-and-running-are-separate-steps"><a class="header" href="#compiling-and-running-are-separate-steps">Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps</a></h3>
<p>You've just run a newly created program, so let's examine each step in the process.</p>
<p>Before running a Rust program, you must compile it using the Rust compiler by entering the <code>rustc</code> command and passing
it the name of your source file, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ rustc main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>If you have a C or C++ background, you’ll notice that this is similar to
<code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code>. After compiling successfully, Rust outputs a binary executable.</p>
<p>You can see the executable by entering the <code>ls</code> command in your shell:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ ls
main.exe  main.pdb  main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>This shows the source code file with the <code>.rs</code> extension, the executable file (<code>main.exe</code> on Windows, but <code>main</code> on all
other platforms), and, when using Windows, a file containing debugging information with the <code>.pdb</code> extension.</p>
<p>Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else,
and they can run it even without having Rust installed.</p>
<p>Just compiling with <code>rustc</code> is fine for simple programs, but as your project grows, you'll want to manage all the
options and make it easy to share your code. Next, we'll introduce you to the Cargo tool, which will help you write
real-world Rust programs.</p>
<h2 id="hello-cargo"><a class="header" href="#hello-cargo">Hello, Cargo!</a></h2>
<p>Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager. Most Rustaceans use
this tool to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks
for you, such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code
depends on, and building those libraries. (We call the libraries that your
code needs dependencies.)</p>
<p>The simplest Rust programs, like the one we’ve written so far, don’t have
any dependencies. If we had built the “Hello, world!” project with Cargo, it
would only use the part of Cargo that handles building your code. As you
write more complex Rust programs, you’ll add dependencies, and if you start
a project using Cargo, adding dependencies will be much easier to do.</p>
<p>Because the vast majority of Rust projects use Cargo, the rest of this
book assumes that you’re using Cargo too. Cargo comes installed with Rust
if you used the official installers discussed in “Installation” on page 1. If you installed Rust through some other
means, check whether Cargo is installed by entering the following in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo --version
</code></pre>
<h3 id="creating-a-project-with-cargo"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-project-with-cargo">Creating a Project with Cargo</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo init
</code></pre>
<p>You'll see that Cargo has generated <code>Cargo.toml</code> file.</p>
<p>It has also initialized a new Git repository along with a <code>.gitignore</code> file. Git files won't be generated if you
run <code>cargo new</code> within an existing Git repository; you can override this behavior by using <code>cargo new --vcs=git</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[package]
name = &quot;hello_world&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
edition = &quot;2021&quot;

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]

[[bin]]
name = &quot;hello_world&quot;
path = &quot;main.rs&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This file is in the TOML(Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) format, which is Cargo's configuration format.</p>
<p>The first line, <code>[package]</code>, is a section heading that indicates that the following statements are configuring a
package. As we add more information to this file we'll add other sections.</p>
<p>The next three lines set the configuration information Cargo needs to compile your program: the name, the version, and
the edition of Rust to use.</p>
<p>The last line, <code>[dependencies]</code>, is the start of a section for you to list any of your project's dependencies. In Rust,
packages of code are referred to as <code>crates</code>. We won't need any other crates for this project, but we will in the first
project in Chapter 2, so we'll use this dependencies section then.</p>
<p>Cargo expects your source files to live inside the <code>src</code> directory. The top-level project directory is just for README
files, license information, configuration files, and anything else not related to your code. Using Cargo helps you
organize your projects. There's a place for everything, and everything is in its place.</p>
<h3 id="building-and-running-a-cargo-project"><a class="header" href="#building-and-running-a-cargo-project">Building and Running a Cargo Project</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build
</code></pre>
<p>This command creates an executable file in <code>target\debug\hello_cargo.exe</code> rather than in your current directory. Because
the default build is a debug build, Cargo puts the binary in a directory named <code>debug</code>. You can run the executable with
this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ ./target/debug/hello_world
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Running <code>cargo build</code> for the first time also causes Cargo to create a new file at the top level: <code>Cargo.lock</code>. This
file keeps track of the exact versions of dependencies in your project. This project doesn't have dependencies, so the
file is a bit sparse. You won't ever need to change this file manually; Cargo manages its contents for you.</p>
<p>We just built a project with cargo build and ran it with <code>./target/debug/ hello_world</code>, but we can also use <code>cargo run</code> to compile the code and then run
the resultant executable all in one command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running `target\debug\hello_world.exe`
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>cargo run</code> is more convenient that having to remember to run <code>cargo build</code> and then use the whole path to the
binary, so most developers use <code>cargo run</code>.</p>
<p>Notice that this time we didn't see output indicating that Cargo was compiling <code>hello_world</code>. Cargo figured out that the
files hadn't changed, so it didn't rebuild but just ran the binary. If you had modified your source code, Cargo would
have rebuilt the project before running it.</p>
<p>Cargo also provides a command called <code>cargo check</code>. This command quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but
doesn't produce an executable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo check
    Checking hello_world v0.1.0 (C:\Users\jerok\projects\study_blog\rust_lang_book\code\ch01\hello_world)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.07s
</code></pre>
<p>Why would you not want an executable? Often, <code>cargo check</code> is much faster then <code>cargo build</code> because it skips the step
of producing an executable. If you're continually checking your work while writing the code, using <code>cargo check</code> will
speed up the process of letting you know if your project is still compiling! As such, many Rustaceans run <code>cargo check</code>
periodically as they write their program to make sure it compiles. Then they run <code>cargo build</code> when they're ready to use
the executable.</p>
<p>Let's recap what we've learned so far about Cargo:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can create a project using <code>cargo new</code>.</li>
<li>We can build a project using <code>cargo build</code>.</li>
<li>We can build and run a project in one step using <code>cargo run</code>.</li>
<li>We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using <code>cargo check</code>.</li>
<li>Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the <code>target/debug</code>
directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>An additional advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the same no matter which operating system you're working
on. So, at this point, we'll no longer provide specific instructions for Linux and macOS versus Windows.</p>
<h3 id="building-for-release"><a class="header" href="#building-for-release">Building for Release</a></h3>
<p>When your project is finally ready for release, you can use <code>cargo build --release</code> to compile it with optimizations.
This command will create an executable in <code>target/release</code> instead of <code>target/debug</code>. The optimizations make your Rust
code run faster, but turning them on lengthens the time it takes for your program to compile. This is why there are two
different profiles: one for development, when you want to rebuild quickly and often, and another for building the final
program you'll give to a user that won't be rebuilt repeatedly and that will run as fast as possible. If you're
benchmarking your code's running time, be sure to run <code>cargo build --release</code> and benchmark with the executable
in <code>target/release</code>.</p>
<h3 id="cargo-as-convention"><a class="header" href="#cargo-as-convention">Cargo as Convention</a></h3>
<p>With simple projects, Cargo doesn't provide a lot of value over just using <code>rustc</code>, but it will prove its worth as your
programs become more intricate.
Once programs grow to multiple files or need a dependency, it's much easier to let Cargo coordinate the build.</p>
<p>Even though the <code>hello_cargo</code> project is simple, it now uses much of the real tooling you'll use in the rest of your
Rust career. In fact, to work on any existing projects, you can use the following commands to check out the code using
Git, change to that project's directory, and build:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">git clone example.org/someproject
cd someproject
cargo build
</code></pre>
<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>You're already off to a great start on your Rust journey! In this chapter, you've learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the latest stable version of Rust using <code>rustup</code></li>
<li>Update to a newer Rust version</li>
<li>Open locally installed documentation</li>
<li>Write and run a &quot;Hello, world!&quot; program using <code>rustc</code> directly</li>
<li>Create and run a new project using the conventions of Cargo</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a great time to build a more substantial program to get used to reading and writing RUst code. So, in Chapter 2,
we'll build a guessing game program. If you would rather start by learning how common programming concepts work in Rust,
see Chapter 3 and then return to Chapter 2.</p>

<p>Let's jump into Rust by working through a hands-on project together! This chapter introduces you to a few common Rust
concepts by showing you how to use them in a real program. You'll learn about <code>let</code>, <code>match</code>, methods, associated
functions, external crates, and more.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-a-new-project"><a class="header" href="#setting-up-a-new-project">Setting Up a New Project</a></h2>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo new guessing_game

<p>The <code>run</code> command comes in handy when you need to rapidly iterate on a project, as we'll do in this game, quickly
testing each iteration before moving on to the next one.</p>
<h2 id="processing-a-guess"><a class="header" href="#processing-a-guess">Processing a Guess</a></h2>
<p>ex 2.1 Code that gets a guess from the user and prints it</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>To obtain user input and then print the result as output, we need to bring the <code>io</code> input/output library into scope.
The <code>io</code> library comes from the standard library, known as <code>std:</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::io;
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {

</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it brings into the scope of every program. This
set is called the prelude, and you can see everything in it at https://doc.rust-lang-org/std/prelude/index.html.</p>
<p>If a type you want to use isn't in the prelude, you have to bring that type into scope explicitly with a <code>use</code>
statement. Using the <code>std::io</code> library provides you with a number of useful features, including the ability to accept
user input.</p>
<p>the <code>main</code> function is the entry point into the program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span>fn main() {
<span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    let mut guess = String::new();
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    io::stdin()
</span><span class="boring">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
</span><span class="boring">        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>fn</code> syntax declares a new function; the parentheses, <code>()</code>, indicate there are no parameters; and the curly
bracket, <code>{</code>, starts the body of the function. <code>println!</code> is a macro that prints a string to the screen:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
<span class="boring">

</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    io::stdin()

</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>This code is printing a prompt stating what the game is and requesting input from the user.</p>
<h3 id="storing-values-with-variables"><a class="header" href="#storing-values-with-variables">Storing Values with Variables</a></h3>
<p>We'll create a variable to store the user input, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span>    let mut guess = String::new();
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    io::stdin()
</span><span class="boring">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
</span><span class="boring">        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>We use the <code>let</code> statement to create the variable. Here's another example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let apples = 5;</code></pre>
<p>This line creates a new variable named <code>apples</code> and binds it to the value <code>5</code>. In Rust, variables are immutable by
default, meaning once we give the variable a value, the value won't change. We'll be discussing this concept in detail
in &quot;Variables and Mutability&quot;. To make a variable mutable, we add <code>mut</code> before the variable name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let apples = 5;  // immutable
let mut bananas = 5;  // mutable</code></pre>
<p><code>let mut guess</code> will introduce a mutable variable named <code>guess</code>. The equal sign (<code>=</code>) tells Rust we want to bind
something to the variable now. On the right of the equal sign is the value that <code>guess</code> is bound to, which is the result
of calling <code>String::new</code>, a function that returns a new instance of a <code>String</code>. <code>String</code> is a string type provided by
the standard library that is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text.</p>
<p>The <code>::</code> syntax in the <code>::new</code> line indicates that <code>new</code> is an associated function of the <code>String</code> type. An associated
function is a function that's implemented on a type, in this case <code>String</code>. This <code>new</code> function creates a new, empty
string. You'll find a <code>new</code> function on many types because it's a common name for a function that makes a new value of
some kind.</p>
<p>In full, the <code>let mut guess = String::new();</code> line has created a mutable variable that is currently bound to a new,
empty instance of a <code>String</code>.</p>
<h3 id="receiving-user-input"><a class="header" href="#receiving-user-input">Receiving User Input</a></h3>
<p>Recall that we included the input/output functionality from the standard library with <code>use std::io;</code> on the first line
of the program. Now we'll call the <code>stdin</code> function from the <code>io</code> module, which will allow us to handle user input:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    let mut guess = String::new();
</span><span class="boring">
</span>    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
<span class="boring">        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>If we hadn't imported the <code>io</code> library with <code>use std::io;</code> at the beginning of the program, we could still use the
function by writing this function call as <code>std::io::stdin</code>. The <code>stdin</code> function returns an instance
of <code>std::io::Stdin</code>, which is a type that represents a handle to the standard input for your terminal.</p>
<p>Next, the line <code>.read_line(&amp;mut guess)</code> calls the <code>read_line</code> method on the standard input handle to get input from the user. We're also passing <code>&amp;mut guess</code> as the argument to <code>read_line</code> to tell it what string to store the user input in. The full job of <code>read_line</code> is to take whatever the user types into standard input and append that into a string (without overwriting its contents), so we therefore pass that string as an argument. The string argument needs to be mutable so the method can change the string's content.</p>
<p>The <code>&amp;</code> indicates that this argument is a reference, which gives you a way to let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to copy that data into memory multiple times. References are a complex feature, and one of Rust's major advantages is how safe and easy it is to use references. You don't need to know a lot of those details to finish this program. For now, all we need to know is that, like variables, references are immutable by default. Hence, we need to write <code>&amp;mut guess</code> rather than <code>&amp;guess</code> to make it mutable.</p>
<h3 id="handling-potential-failure-with-result"><a class="header" href="#handling-potential-failure-with-result">Handling Potential Failure with Result</a></h3>

<p><code>read_line</code> puts whatever the user enters into the string we pass to it, but it also returns a <code>Result</code> value. <code>Result</code> is an enumeration, often called an <code>enum</code>, which is a type that can be in one of multiple possible states. We call each possible state a variant.</p>
<p>The purpose of these <code>Result</code> type is to encode error-handling information.</p>
<p><code>Result</code>'s variants are <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code>. The <code>Ok</code> variant indicates the operation was successful, and inside <code>Ok</code> is the successfully generated value. The <code>Err</code> variant means the operation failed, and <code>Err</code> contains information about how or why the operation failed.</p>
<p>Values of the <code>Result</code> type, like values of any type, have methods defined on them. An instance of <code>Result</code> has an <code>expect</code> method that you can call. If this instance of <code>Result</code> is an <code>Err</code> value, <code>expect</code> will cause the program to crash and display the message that you passed as an argument to <code>expect</code>. If the <code>read_line</code> method returns an <code>Err</code>, it would likely be the result of an error coming from the underlying operating system. If this instance of <code>Result</code> is an <code>Ok</code> value, <code>expect</code> will take the return value that <code>Ok</code> is holding and return just that value to you so you can use it. In this case, that value is the number of bytes in the user's input.</p>
<p>If you don't call <code>expect</code>, the program will compile, but you'll get a warning:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build

<p>Rust warns that you haven't used the <code>Result</code> value returned from <code>read_line</code>, indicating that the program hasn't handled a possible error.</p>
<p>The right way to suppress the warning is to actually write error-handling code, but in our case we just want to crash this program when a problem occurs, so we can use <code>expect</code>.</p>

<p>This line prints the string that now contains the user's input. The <code>{}</code> set of curly brackets is a placeholder: think of <code>{}</code> as little crab pincers that hold a value in place. When printing the value of a variable, the variable name can go inside the curly brackets. When printing the result of evaluating an expression, place empty curly brackets in the format string, then follow the format string with a comma-separated list of expressions to print in each empty curly bracket placeholder in the same order. Printing a variable and the result of an expression in one call to <code>println!</code> would look like this:</p>

<h2 id="generating-a-secret-number"><a class="header" href="#generating-a-secret-number">Generating a Secret Number</a></h2>
<p>Next, we need to generate a secret number that the user will try to guess. We'll use a random number between 1 and 100. Rust doesn't yet include random number functionality in its standard library. However, the Rust team does provide a <code>rand</code> crate at https://crates.io/crates/rand with said functionality.</p>
<h3 id="using-a-crate-to-get-more-functionality"><a class="header" href="#using-a-crate-to-get-more-functionality">Using a Crate to Get More Functionality</a></h3>
<p>Remember that a crate is a collection of Rust source code files. The project we've been building is a binary crate, which is an executable. The <code>rand</code> crate is a library crate, which contains code that is intended to be used in other programs and can't be executed on its own.</p>
<p>Cargo's coordination of external crates is where Cargo really shines. Before we can write code that uses <code>rand</code>, we need to modify the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file to include the <code>rand</code> crate as a dependency. Open that file now and add the following line to the bottom, beneath the <code>[dependencies]</code> section header that Cargo created for you. Be sure to specify <code>rand</code> exactly as we have here, with this version number, or the code examples in this tutorial may not work.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
rand = &quot;0.8.5&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file, everything that follows a header is part of that section that continues until another section starts. In <code>[dependencies]</code> you tell Cargo which external crates your project depends on and which versions of those crates you require. In this case, we specify the <code>rand</code> crate with the semantic version specifier <code>0.8.5</code>. Cargo understands Semantic Versioning(sometimes called SemVer), which is a standard for writing version numbers. The specifier <code>0.8.5</code> is actually shorthand for <code>^0.8.5</code>, which means any version that is at least 0.8.5 but below 0.9.0.</p>
<p>Cargo considers these versions to have public APIs compatible with version 0.8.5, and this specification ensures you'll get the latest patch release that will still compile with the code in this chapter.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build

</code></pre>
<p>When we include an external dependency, Cargo fetches the latest versions of everything that dependency needs from the registry, which is a copy of data from Crates.io at https://crates.io. Crates.io is where people in the Rust ecosystem post their open source Rust projects for others to use.</p>
<p>After updating the registry, Cargo checks the <code>[dependencies]</code> section and downloads any crates listed that aren't already downloaded. In this case, although we only listed <code>rand</code> as a dependency, Cargo also grabbed other crates that <code>rand</code> depends on to work. After downloading the crates, Rust compiles them and then compiles the project with the dependencies available.</p>
<p>If you immediately run <code>cargo build</code> again without making any changes, you won't get any output aside from the <code>Finished</code> line. Cargo knows it has already downloaded and compiled the dependencies, and you haven't changed anything about them in your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file. Cargo also knows that you haven't changed anything about your code, so it doesn't recompile that either. With nothing to do, it simply exits.</p>
<h4 id="ensuring-reproducible-builds-with-the-cargolock-file"><a class="header" href="#ensuring-reproducible-builds-with-the-cargolock-file">Ensuring Reproducible Builds with the Cargo.lock File</a></h4>
<p>Cargo has a mechanism that ensures you can rebuild the same artifact every time you or anyone else builds your code: Cargo will use only the versions of the dependencies you specified until you indicate otherwise. For example, say that next week version 0.8.6 of the <code>rand</code> crate comes out, and that version contains an important bug fix, but it also contains a regression that will break your code. To handle this, Rust creates the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file the first time you run <code>cargo build</code>, so we now have this in the <code>guessing_game</code> directory.</p>
<p>When you build a project for the first time, Cargo figures out all the versions of the dependencies that fit the criteria and then writes them to the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file. When you build your project in the future, Cargo will see that the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file exists and will use the versions specified there rather than doing all the work of figuring out versions again. This lets you have a reproducible build automatically. In other words, your project will remain at 0.8.5 until you explicitly upgrade, thanks to the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file. Because the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file is important for reproducible builds, it's often checked into source control with the rest of the code in your project.</p>
<h4 id="updating-a-crate-to-get-a-new-version"><a class="header" href="#updating-a-crate-to-get-a-new-version">Updating a Crate to Get a New Version</a></h4>
<p>When you do want to update a crate, Cargo provides the command <code>update</code>, which will ignore the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file and figure out all the latest versions that fit your specifications in <code>Cargo.toml</code>. Cargo will then write those versions to the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file. Otherwise, by default, Cargo will only look for versions greater than 0.8.5 and less than 0.9.0.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to say about Cargo and its ecosystem, which we'll discuss in Chapter 14, but for now, that's all we need to know. Cargo makes it very easy to reuse libraries, so Rustaceans are able to write smaller projects that are assembled from a number of packages.</p>

<p>First we add the line <code>use rand::Rng;</code>(1).
The <code>Rng</code> trait defines methods that random number generators implement,
and this trait must be in scope for ust to use those methods.
Chapter 10 will cover traits in detail.</p>
<p>Next, we're adding two lines in the middle.
In the first line (2),
we call the <code>rand::thread_rng</code> function that gives us the particular random number generator we're going to use:
one that is local to the current thread of execution and is seeded by the operating system.
Then we call the <code>gen_range</code> method on the random number generator.
This method is defined by the <code>Rng</code> trait that we brought into scope with the <code>use rand::Rng;</code> statement.
The <code>gen_range</code> method takes a range expression as an argument and generates a random number in the rage.
The kind of range expression we're using here takes the from
<code>start..=end</code> and is inclusive on the lower and upper bounds,
so we need to specify <code>1..=100</code> to request a number between 1 and 100.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You won't just know which traits to use and which methods and functions to call from a crate, so each crate has documentation with instructions for using it. Another neat feature of Cargo is that running the <code>cargo doc --open</code> command will build documentation provided by all your dependencies locally and open it in your browser. If you're interested in other functionality in the <code>rand</code> crate, for example, run <code>cargo doc --open</code> and click <code>rand</code> in the sidebar on the left.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second new line (3) prints the secret number.
This is useful while we're developing the program to be able to test it, but we'll delete it from the final version.
It's not much of a game if the program prints the answer as soon as it starts!</p>

<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>First we add another <code>use</code> statement (1),
bringing a type called <code>std::cmp::Ordering</code> into scope from the standard library.
The <code>Ordering</code> type is another enum and has the variants <code>Less</code>, <code>Greater</code>, and <code>Equal</code>.
These are the three outcomes that are possible when you compare two values.</p>
<p>Then we add five new lines at the bottom that use the <code>Ordering</code> type.
The <code>cmp</code> method (3) compares two values and can be called on anything that can be compared.
It takes a reference to whatever you want to compare with: here it's comparing <code>guess</code> to <code>secret_number</code>.
Then it returns a variant of the <code>Ordering</code> enum we brought into scope with the <code>use</code> statement.
We use a <code>match</code> expression (2)
to decide what to do next based on which variant of <code>Ordering</code> was returned from the call to <code>cmp</code> with the values in <code>guess</code> and <code>secret_number</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>match</code> expression is made up of arms.
An arm consists of a pattern to match against,
and the code that should be run if the value given to <code>match</code> fits that arm's pattern.
Rust takes the value given to <code>match</code> and looks through each arm's pattern in turn.
Patterns and the <code>match</code> construct are powerful Rust features:
they let you express a variety of situations your code might encounter and they make sure you handle them all.
These features will be covered in detail in Chapter 6 and Chapter 18, respectively.</p>
<p>Let's walk through an example with the <code>match</code> expression we use here. Say that the user has guessed 50 and the randomly generated secret number this time is 38.</p>
<p>When the code compares 50 to 38, the <code>cmp</code> method will return <code>Ordering::Greater</code> because 50 is greater than 38. The <code>match</code> expression gets the <code>Ordering::Greater</code> value and starts checking each arm's pattern. It looks at the first arm's pattern, <code>Ordering::Less</code>, and sees that the value <code>Ordering::Greater</code> does not match <code>Ordering::Less</code>, so it ignores the code in that arm and moves to the next arm. The next arm's pattern is <code>Ordering::Greater</code>, which does match <code>Ordering::Greater</code>! The associated code in that arm will execute and print <code>Too big!</code> to the screen. The <code>match</code> expression ends after the first successful match, so it won't look at the last arm in this scenario. However, the code won't compile yet.</p>

error: could not compile `guessing_game` due to previous error
</code></pre>
<p>The core of the error states that there are mismatched types. Rust has a strong, static type system. However, it also has type inference. When we wrote <code>let mut guess = String::new()</code>, Rust was able to infer that <code>guess</code> should be a <code>String</code> and didn't make us write the type. The <code>secret_number</code>, on the other hand, is a number type. A few of Rust's number types can have a value between 1 and 100: <code>i32</code>, a 32-bit number; <code>u32</code>, an unsigned 32-bit number; <code>i64</code>, a 64-bit number; as well as others. Unless otherwise specified, Rust defaults to an <code>i32</code>, which is the type of <code>secret_number</code> unless you add type information elsewhere that would cause Rust to infer a different numerical type. The reason for the error is that Rust cannot compare a string and a number type.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we want to convert the <code>String</code> the program reads as input into a real number type so we can compare it numerically to the secret number. We do so by adding this line to the <code>main</code> function body:</p>

<p>We create a variable named <code>guess</code>. But wait, doesn't the program already have a variable named <code>guess</code>? It does but helpfully Rust allows us to shadow the previous value of <code>guess</code> with a new one. Shadowing lets us reuse the <code>guess</code> variable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables, such as <code>guess_str</code> and <code>guess</code>, for example. We'll cover this in more detail in Chapter 3, but for now, know that this feature is often used when you want to conver a value from one type to another type.</p>
<p>We bind this new variable to the expression <code>guess.trim().parse()</code>. The <code>guess</code> in the expression refers to the original <code>guess</code> variable that contained the input as a string. The <code>trim</code> method on a <code>String</code> instance will eliminate any whitespace at the beginning and end, which we must do to be able to compare the string to the <code>u32</code>, which can only contain numerical data. The user must press ENTER to satisfy <code>read_line</code> and input their guess, which adds a newline character to the string. For example, if the user types 5 and presses ENTER, <code>guess</code> looks like this: <code>5\n</code>. The <code>\n</code> represents &quot;newline.&quot; (On Windows, pressing ENTER results in a carriage return and a newline, <code>\r\n</code>.) The <code>trim</code> method eliminates <code>\n</code> or <code>\r\n</code>, resulting in just 5.</p>
<p>The <code>parse</code> method on strings converts a string to another type. Here, we use it to convert from a string to a number. We need to tell Rust the exact number type we want by using <code>let guess: u32</code>. The colon (<code>:</code>) after <code>guess</code> tells Rust we'll annotate the variable's type. Rust has a few built-in number types; the <code>u32</code> seen here is an unsigned, 32-bit integer. It's a good default choice for a small positive number. You'll learn about other number types in Chapter 3.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <code>u32</code> annotation in this example program and the comparison with <code>secret_number</code> means Rust will infer that <code>secret_number</code> should be a <code>u32</code> as well. So now the comparison will be between two values of the same type!</p>
<p>The <code>parse</code> method will only work on characters that can logically be converted into numbers and so can easily cause errors. If, for example, the string contained <code>A👍%</code>, there would be no way to convert that to a number. Because it might fail, the <code>parse</code> method returns a <code>Result</code> type, much as the <code>read_line</code> method does (discussed earlier in &quot;Handling Potential Failure with Result&quot;). We'll treat this <code>Result</code> the same way by using the <code>expect</code> method again. If <code>parse</code> returns an <code>Err Result</code> variant because it couldn't create a number from the string, the <code>expect</code> call will crash the game and print the message we give it. If <code>parse</code> can successfully convert the string to a number, it will return the <code>Ok</code> variant of <code>Result</code>, and <code>expect</code> will return the number that we want from the <code>Ok</code> value.</p>

<p>Nice! Even though spaces were added before the guess, the program still figured out that the user guessed 77.

<p>Let's change that by adding a loop!</p>

<p>As you can see, we've moved everything from the guess input prompt onward into a loop.
Be sure to indent the lines inside the loop another four spaces each and run the program again. The program will now ask for another guess forever, which actually introduces a new problem.
It doesn't seem like the user can quit!</p>
<p>The user could always interrupt the program by using the keyboard shortcut CTRL-C. But there's another way to escape this insatiable monster as mentioned in the <code>parse</code> discussion in &quot;Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number&quot;: if the user enters a non-number answer, the program will crash. We can take advantage of that to allow the user to quit, as shown here:</p>

<p>We switch from an <code>expect</code> call to a <code>match</code> expression to move from crashing on an error to handling the error. Remember that <code>parse</code> returns a <code>Result</code> type and <code>Result</code> is an enum that has the variants <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code>. We're using a <code>match</code> expression here, as we did with the <code>Ordering</code> result of the <code>cmp</code> method.</p>
<p>If <code>parse</code> is able to successfully turn the string into a number, it will return an <code>Ok</code> value that contains the resultant number. That <code>Ok</code> value will match the first arm's pattern, and the <code>match</code> expression will just return the <code>num</code> value that <code>parse</code> produced and put inside the <code>Ok</code> value. That number will end up right where we want it in the new <code>guess</code> variable we're creating.</p>
<p>If <code>parse</code> is not able to turn the string into a number, it will return an <code>Err</code> value that contains more information about the error. The <code>Err</code> value does not match the <code>Ok(num)</code> pattern in the first <code>match</code> arm, but it does match the <code>Err(_)</code> pattern in the second arm. The underscore, <code>_</code>, is a catch-all value; in this example, we're saying we want to match all <code>Err</code> values, no matter what information they have inside them. So the program will execute the second arm's code, <code>continue</code>, which tells the program to go to the next iteration of the <code>loop</code> and ask for another guess. So, effectively, the program ignores all errors that <code>parse</code> might encounter!</p>

<h2 id="summary-1"><a class="header" href="#summary-1">Summary</a></h2>
<p>This project was a hands-on way to introduce you to many new Rust concepts: <code>let</code>, <code>match</code>, functions, the use of external crates, and more. In the next few chapters, you'll learn about these concepts in more detail. Chapter 3 covers concepts that most programming languages have, such as variables, data types, and functions, and shows how to use them in Rust. Chapter 4 explores ownership, a feature that makes Rust different from other languages. Chapter 5 discusses structs and method syntax, and Chapter 6 explains how enums work.</p>
