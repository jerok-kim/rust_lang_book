<p>Let's start our Rust jorney! There's a lot to learn, but every journey starts somewhere. In this chapter, we'll discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing Rust on Linux, macOS, and Windows</li>
<li>Writing a program that prints <code>Hello, world!</code></li>
<li>Using <code>cargo</code>, Rust's package manager and build system</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installiation"><a class="header" href="#installiation">Installiation</a></h2>
<p>The first step is to install Rust. We'll download Rust through <code>rustup</code>, command line tool for managing Rust versions
and associated tools.</p>
<p>The following steps install the latest stable version of the Rust compiler.
Rust's stability guarantees ensure that all the examples in the book that compile will continue to compile with newer
Rust versions.</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">$ rustup update

<h3 id="local-documentation"><a class="header" href="#local-documentation">Local Documentation</a></h3>
<p>The installation of Rust also includes a local copy of the documentation so that you can read it offline.
Run <code>rustup doc</code> to open the local documentation in your browser.</p>
<p>Any time a type or function is provided by the standard library and you're not sure what it does or how to use it, use
the application programming interface (API) documentation to find out!</p>
<h2 id="hello-world"><a class="header" href="#hello-world">Hello, World!</a></h2>
<p>Now that you’ve installed Rust, it’s time to write your first Rust program.
It’s traditional when learning a new language to write a little program that
prints the text <code>Hello, world!</code> to the screen, so we’ll do the same here!</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-project-directory"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-project-directory">Creating a Project Directory</a></h3>
<p>You’ll start by making a directory to store your Rust code. It doesn’t matter to Rust where your code lives, but for the
exercises and projects in this book, we suggest making a projects directory in your home directory and keeping all your
projects there.
Open a terminal and enter the following commands to make a projects
directory and a directory for the “Hello, world!” project within the
projects directory.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world
</code></pre>
<h3 id="writing-and-running-a-rust-program"><a class="header" href="#writing-and-running-a-rust-program">Writing and Running a Rust Program</a></h3>
<p>Next, make a new source file and call it <code>main.rs</code>. Rust files always end with the <code>.rs</code> extension. If you're using more
than one word in your filename, the convention is to use an underscore to separate them. For example,
use <code>hello_world.rs</code> rather than <code>helloworld.rs</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>Hello, world!</code> did print, congratulations! You've officially written a Rust program. That makes you a Rust
programmer - welcome!</p>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-a-rust-program"><a class="header" href="#anatomy-of-a-rust-program">Anatomy of a Rust Program</a></h3>
<p>Let’s review this “Hello, world!” program in detail. Here’s the first piece of
the puzzle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
<span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
</span>}</code></pre>
<p>These lines define a function named <code>main</code>. The <code>main</code> function is special: it is always the first code that runs in
every executable Rust program. Here the first line declares a function named <code>main</code> that has no parameters and returns
nothing. If there were parameters, they would go inside the parentheses <code>()</code>.</p>
<p>The function body is wrapped in <code>{}</code>. Rust requires curly brackets around all function bodies. It's good style to place
the opening curly bracket on the same line as the function declaration, adding one space in between.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to stick to a standard style across Rust projects, you can use an automatic
formatter tool called rustfmt to format your code in a particular style (more on rustfmt
in Appendix D). The Rust team has included this tool with the standard Rust distribution, as rustc is, so it should
already be installed on your computer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The body of the <code>main</code> function hold the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>This line does all the work in this little program: it prints text to the screen. There are four important details to
notice here.</p>
<p>First, Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.</p>
<p>Second, <code>println!</code> calls a Rust macro. If it had called a function instead, it would be entered as <code>println</code>(without
the <code>!</code>). We'll discuss Rust macros in more detail in Chapter 19. For now, you just need to know that using a <code>!</code> means
that you're calling a macro instead of a normal function and that macros don't always follow the same rules as
functions.</p>
<p>Third, you see the <code>&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</code> string. We pass this string as an argument to <code>println!</code>, and the string is printed
to the screen.</p>
<p>Fourth, we end the line with a semicolon(<code>;</code>), which indicates that this expression is over and the next one is ready to
begin. Most lines of Rust code end with a semicolon.</p>
<h3 id="compiling-and-running-are-separate-steps"><a class="header" href="#compiling-and-running-are-separate-steps">Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps</a></h3>
<p>You've just run a newly created program, so let's examine each step in the process.</p>
<p>Before running a Rust program, you must compile it using the Rust compiler by entering the <code>rustc</code> command and passing
it the name of your source file, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ rustc main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>If you have a C or C++ background, you’ll notice that this is similar to
<code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code>. After compiling successfully, Rust outputs a binary executable.</p>
<p>You can see the executable by entering the <code>ls</code> command in your shell:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ ls
main.exe  main.pdb  main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>This shows the source code file with the <code>.rs</code> extension, the executable file (<code>main.exe</code> on Windows, but <code>main</code> on all
other platforms), and, when using Windows, a file containing debugging information with the <code>.pdb</code> extension.</p>
<p>Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else,
and they can run it even without having Rust installed.</p>
<p>Just compiling with <code>rustc</code> is fine for simple programs, but as your project grows, you'll want to manage all the
options and make it easy to share your code. Next, we'll introduce you to the Cargo tool, which will help you write
real-world Rust programs.</p>
<h2 id="hello-cargo"><a class="header" href="#hello-cargo">Hello, Cargo!</a></h2>
<p>Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager. Most Rustaceans use
this tool to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks
for you, such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code
depends on, and building those libraries. (We call the libraries that your
code needs dependencies.)</p>
<p>The simplest Rust programs, like the one we’ve written so far, don’t have
any dependencies. If we had built the “Hello, world!” project with Cargo, it
would only use the part of Cargo that handles building your code. As you
write more complex Rust programs, you’ll add dependencies, and if you start
a project using Cargo, adding dependencies will be much easier to do.</p>
<p>Because the vast majority of Rust projects use Cargo, the rest of this
book assumes that you’re using Cargo too. Cargo comes installed with Rust
if you used the official installers discussed in “Installation” on page 1. If you installed Rust through some other
means, check whether Cargo is installed by entering the following in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo --version
</code></pre>
<h3 id="creating-a-project-with-cargo"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-project-with-cargo">Creating a Project with Cargo</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo init
</code></pre>
<p>You'll see that Cargo has generated <code>Cargo.toml</code> file.</p>
<p>It has also initialized a new Git repository along with a <code>.gitignore</code> file. Git files won't be generated if you
run <code>cargo new</code> within an existing Git repository; you can override this behavior by using <code>cargo new --vcs=git</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[package]
name = &quot;hello_world&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
edition = &quot;2021&quot;

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]

[[bin]]
name = &quot;hello_world&quot;
path = &quot;main.rs&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This file is in the TOML(Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) format, which is Cargo's configuration format.</p>
<p>The first line, <code>[package]</code>, is a section heading that indicates that the following statements are configuring a
package. As we add more information to this file we'll add other sections.</p>
<p>The next three lines set the configuration information Cargo needs to compile your program: the name, the version, and
the edition of Rust to use.</p>
<p>The last line, <code>[dependencies]</code>, is the start of a section for you to list any of your project's dependencies. In Rust,
packages of code are referred to as <code>crates</code>. We won't need any other crates for this project, but we will in the first
project in Chapter 2, so we'll use this dependencies section then.</p>
<p>Cargo expects your source files to live inside the <code>src</code> directory. The top-level project directory is just for README
files, license information, configuration files, and anything else not related to your code. Using Cargo helps you
organize your projects. There's a place for everything, and everything is in its place.</p>
<h3 id="building-and-running-a-cargo-project"><a class="header" href="#building-and-running-a-cargo-project">Building and Running a Cargo Project</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build
</code></pre>
<p>This command creates an executable file in <code>target\debug\hello_cargo.exe</code> rather than in your current directory. Because
the default build is a debug build, Cargo puts the binary in a directory named <code>debug</code>. You can run the executable with
this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ ./target/debug/hello_world
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Running <code>cargo build</code> for the first time also causes Cargo to create a new file at the top level: <code>Cargo.lock</code>. This
file keeps track of the exact versions of dependencies in your project. This project doesn't have dependencies, so the
file is a bit sparse. You won't ever need to change this file manually; Cargo manages its contents for you.</p>
<p>We just built a project with cargo build and ran it with <code>./target/debug/ hello_world</code>, but we can also use <code>cargo run</code> to compile the code and then run
the resultant executable all in one command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running `target\debug\hello_world.exe`
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>cargo run</code> is more convenient that having to remember to run <code>cargo build</code> and then use the whole path to the
binary, so most developers use <code>cargo run</code>.</p>
<p>Notice that this time we didn't see output indicating that Cargo was compiling <code>hello_world</code>. Cargo figured out that the
files hadn't changed, so it didn't rebuild but just ran the binary. If you had modified your source code, Cargo would
have rebuilt the project before running it.</p>
<p>Cargo also provides a command called <code>cargo check</code>. This command quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but
doesn't produce an executable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo check
    Checking hello_world v0.1.0 (C:\Users\jerok\projects\study_blog\rust_lang_book\code\ch01\hello_world)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.07s
</code></pre>
<p>Why would you not want an executable? Often, <code>cargo check</code> is much faster then <code>cargo build</code> because it skips the step
of producing an executable. If you're continually checking your work while writing the code, using <code>cargo check</code> will
speed up the process of letting you know if your project is still compiling! As such, many Rustaceans run <code>cargo check</code>
periodically as they write their program to make sure it compiles. Then they run <code>cargo build</code> when they're ready to use
the executable.</p>
<p>Let's recap what we've learned so far about Cargo:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can create a project using <code>cargo new</code>.</li>
<li>We can build a project using <code>cargo build</code>.</li>
<li>We can build and run a project in one step using <code>cargo run</code>.</li>
<li>We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using <code>cargo check</code>.</li>
<li>Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the <code>target/debug</code>
directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>An additional advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the same no matter which operating system you're working
on. So, at this point, we'll no longer provide specific instructions for Linux and macOS versus Windows.</p>
<h3 id="building-for-release"><a class="header" href="#building-for-release">Building for Release</a></h3>
<p>When your project is finally ready for release, you can use <code>cargo build --release</code> to compile it with optimizations.
This command will create an executable in <code>target/release</code> instead of <code>target/debug</code>. The optimizations make your Rust
code run faster, but turning them on lengthens the time it takes for your program to compile. This is why there are two
different profiles: one for development, when you want to rebuild quickly and often, and another for building the final
program you'll give to a user that won't be rebuilt repeatedly and that will run as fast as possible. If you're
benchmarking your code's running time, be sure to run <code>cargo build --release</code> and benchmark with the executable
in <code>target/release</code>.</p>
<h3 id="cargo-as-convention"><a class="header" href="#cargo-as-convention">Cargo as Convention</a></h3>
<p>With simple projects, Cargo doesn't provide a lot of value over just using <code>rustc</code>, but it will prove its worth as your
programs become more intricate.
Once programs grow to multiple files or need a dependency, it's much easier to let Cargo coordinate the build.</p>
<p>Even though the <code>hello_cargo</code> project is simple, it now uses much of the real tooling you'll use in the rest of your
Rust career. In fact, to work on any existing projects, you can use the following commands to check out the code using
Git, change to that project's directory, and build:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">git clone example.org/someproject
cd someproject
cargo build
</code></pre>
<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>You're already off to a great start on your Rust journey! In this chapter, you've learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the latest stable version of Rust using <code>rustup</code></li>
<li>Update to a newer Rust version</li>
<li>Open locally installed documentation</li>
<li>Write and run a &quot;Hello, world!&quot; program using <code>rustc</code> directly</li>
<li>Create and run a new project using the conventions of Cargo</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a great time to build a more substantial program to get used to reading and writing RUst code. So, in Chapter 2,
we'll build a guessing game program. If you would rather start by learning how common programming concepts work in Rust,
see Chapter 3 and then return to Chapter 2.</p>

concepts by showing you how to use them in a real program. You'll learn about <code>let</code>, <code>match</code>, methods, associated
functions, external crates, and more.</p>

<p>The <code>run</code> command comes in handy when you need to rapidly iterate on a project, as we'll do in this game, quickly
testing each iteration before moving on to the next one.</p>
<h2 id="processing-a-guess"><a class="header" href="#processing-a-guess">Processing a Guess</a></h2>
<p>ex 2.1 Code that gets a guess from the user and prints it</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

<p>To obtain user input and then print the result as output, we need to bring the <code>io</code> input/output library into scope.
The <code>io</code> library comes from the standard library, known as <code>std:</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::io;
<span class="boring">

</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it brings into the scope of every program. This
set is called the prelude, and you can see everything in it at https://doc.rust-lang-org/std/prelude/index.html.</p>
<p>If a type you want to use isn't in the prelude, you have to bring that type into scope explicitly with a <code>use</code>
statement. Using the <code>std::io</code> library provides you with a number of useful features, including the ability to accept
user input.</p>
<p>the <code>main</code> function is the entry point into the program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span>fn main() {
<span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    let mut guess = String::new();
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    io::stdin()
</span><span class="boring">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)

</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>fn</code> syntax declares a new function; the parentheses, <code>()</code>, indicate there are no parameters; and the curly
bracket, <code>{</code>, starts the body of the function. <code>println!</code> is a macro that prints a string to the screen:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>This code is printing a prompt stating what the game is and requesting input from the user.</p>
<h3 id="storing-values-with-variables"><a class="header" href="#storing-values-with-variables">Storing Values with Variables</a></h3>
<p>We'll create a variable to store the user input, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span>    let mut guess = String::new();
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    io::stdin()
</span><span class="boring">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
</span><span class="boring">        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>We use the <code>let</code> statement to create the variable. Here's another example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let apples = 5;</code></pre>
<p>This line creates a new variable named <code>apples</code> and binds it to the value <code>5</code>. In Rust, variables are immutable by
default, meaning once we give the variable a value, the value won't change. We'll be discussing this concept in detail
in &quot;Variables and Mutability&quot;. To make a variable mutable, we add <code>mut</code> before the variable name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let apples = 5;  // immutable
let mut bananas = 5;  // mutable</code></pre>
<p><code>let mut guess</code> will introduce a mutable variable named <code>guess</code>. The equal sign (<code>=</code>) tells Rust we want to bind
something to the variable now. On the right of the equal sign is the value that <code>guess</code> is bound to, which is the result
of calling <code>String::new</code>, a function that returns a new instance of a <code>String</code>. <code>String</code> is a string type provided by
the standard library that is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text.</p>
<p>The <code>::</code> syntax in the <code>::new</code> line indicates that <code>new</code> is an associated function of the <code>String</code> type. An associated
function is a function that's implemented on a type, in this case <code>String</code>. This <code>new</code> function creates a new, empty
string. You'll find a <code>new</code> function on many types because it's a common name for a function that makes a new value of
some kind.</p>
<p>In full, the <code>let mut guess = String::new();</code> line has created a mutable variable that is currently bound to a new,
empty instance of a <code>String</code>.</p>
<h3 id="receiving-user-input"><a class="header" href="#receiving-user-input">Receiving User Input</a></h3>
<p>Recall that we included the input/output functionality from the standard library with <code>use std::io;</code> on the first line
of the program. Now we'll call the <code>stdin</code> function from the <code>io</code> module, which will allow us to handle user input:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    let mut guess = String::new();
</span><span class="boring">
</span>    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
<span class="boring">        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>If we hadn't imported the <code>io</code> library with <code>use std::io;</code> at the beginning of the program, we could still use the
function by writing this function call as <code>std::io::stdin</code>. The <code>stdin</code> function returns an instance
of <code>std::io::Stdin</code>, which is a type that represents a handle to the standard input for your terminal.</p>
<p>Next, the line <code>.read_line(&amp;mut guess)</code> calls the <code>read_line</code> method on the standard input handle to get input from the user. We're also passing <code>&amp;mut guess</code> as the argument to <code>read_line</code> to tell it what string to store the user input in. The full job of <code>read_line</code> is to take whatever the user types into standard input and append that into a string (without overwriting its contents), so we therefore pass that string as an argument. The string argument needs to be mutable so the method can change the string's content.</p>
<p>The <code>&amp;</code> indicates that this argument is a reference, which gives you a way to let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to copy that data into memory multiple times. References are a complex feature, and one of Rust's major advantages is how safe and easy it is to use references. You don't need to know a lot of those details to finish this program. For now, all we need to know is that, like variables, references are immutable by default. Hence, we need to write <code>&amp;mut guess</code> rather than <code>&amp;guess</code> to make it mutable.</p>
<h3 id="handling-potential-failure-with-result"><a class="header" href="#handling-potential-failure-with-result">Handling Potential Failure with Result</a></h3>

<p><code>read_line</code> puts whatever the user enters into the string we pass to it, but it also returns a <code>Result</code> value. <code>Result</code> is an enumeration, often called an <code>enum</code>, which is a type that can be in one of multiple possible states. We call each possible state a variant.</p>
<p>The purpose of these <code>Result</code> type is to encode error-handling information.</p>
<p><code>Result</code>'s variants are <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code>. The <code>Ok</code> variant indicates the operation was successful, and inside <code>Ok</code> is the successfully generated value. The <code>Err</code> variant means the operation failed, and <code>Err</code> contains information about how or why the operation failed.</p>
<p>Values of the <code>Result</code> type, like values of any type, have methods defined on them. An instance of <code>Result</code> has an <code>expect</code> method that you can call. If this instance of <code>Result</code> is an <code>Err</code> value, <code>expect</code> will cause the program to crash and display the message that you passed as an argument to <code>expect</code>. If the <code>read_line</code> method returns an <code>Err</code>, it would likely be the result of an error coming from the underlying operating system. If this instance of <code>Result</code> is an <code>Ok</code> value, <code>expect</code> will take the return value that <code>Ok</code> is holding and return just that value to you so you can use it. In this case, that value is the number of bytes in the user's input.</p>
<p>If you don't call <code>expect</code>, the program will compile, but you'll get a warning:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build

<p>Rust warns that you haven't used the <code>Result</code> value returned from <code>read_line</code>, indicating that the program hasn't handled a possible error.</p>
<p>The right way to suppress the warning is to actually write error-handling code, but in our case we just want to crash this program when a problem occurs, so we can use <code>expect</code>.</p>

<p>This line prints the string that now contains the user's input. The <code>{}</code> set of curly brackets is a placeholder: think of <code>{}</code> as little crab pincers that hold a value in place. When printing the value of a variable, the variable name can go inside the curly brackets. When printing the result of evaluating an expression, place empty curly brackets in the format string, then follow the format string with a comma-separated list of expressions to print in each empty curly bracket placeholder in the same order.

<h2 id="generating-a-secret-number"><a class="header" href="#generating-a-secret-number">Generating a Secret Number</a></h2>
<p>Next, we need to generate a secret number that the user will try to guess. We'll use a random number between 1 and 100. Rust doesn't yet include random number functionality in its standard library. However, the Rust team does provide a <code>rand</code> crate at https://crates.io/crates/rand with said functionality.</p>
<h3 id="using-a-crate-to-get-more-functionality"><a class="header" href="#using-a-crate-to-get-more-functionality">Using a Crate to Get More Functionality</a></h3>
<p>Remember that a crate is a collection of Rust source code files. The project we've been building is a binary crate, which is an executable. The <code>rand</code> crate is a library crate, which contains code that is intended to be used in other programs and can't be executed on its own.</p>
<p>Cargo's coordination of external crates is where Cargo really shines. Before we can write code that uses <code>rand</code>, we need to modify the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file to include the <code>rand</code> crate as a dependency. Open that file now and add the following line to the bottom, beneath the <code>[dependencies]</code> section header that Cargo created for you. Be sure to specify <code>rand</code> exactly as we have here, with this version number, or the code examples in this tutorial may not work.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
rand = &quot;0.8.5&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file, everything that follows a header is part of that section that continues until another section starts. In <code>[dependencies]</code> you tell Cargo which external crates your project depends on and which versions of those crates you require. In this case, we specify the <code>rand</code> crate with the semantic version specifier <code>0.8.5</code>. Cargo understands Semantic Versioning(sometimes called SemVer), which is a standard for writing version numbers. The specifier <code>0.8.5</code> is actually shorthand for <code>^0.8.5</code>, which means any version that is at least 0.8.5 but below 0.9.0.</p>
<p>Cargo considers these versions to have public APIs compatible with version 0.8.5, and this specification ensures you'll get the latest patch release that will still compile with the code in this chapter.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build

</code></pre>
<p>When we include an external dependency, Cargo fetches the latest versions of everything that dependency needs from the registry, which is a copy of data from Crates.io at https://crates.io. Crates.io is where people in the Rust ecosystem post their open source Rust projects for others to use.</p>
<p>After updating the registry, Cargo checks the <code>[dependencies]</code> section and downloads any crates listed that aren't already downloaded. In this case, although we only listed <code>rand</code> as a dependency, Cargo also grabbed other crates that <code>rand</code> depends on to work. After downloading the crates, Rust compiles them and then compiles the project with the dependencies available.</p>
<p>If you immediately run <code>cargo build</code> again without making any changes, you won't get any output aside from the <code>Finished</code> line. Cargo knows it has already downloaded and compiled the dependencies, and you haven't changed anything about them in your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file. Cargo also knows that you haven't changed anything about your code, so it doesn't recompile that either. With nothing to do, it simply exits.</p>
<h4 id="ensuring-reproducible-builds-with-the-cargolock-file"><a class="header" href="#ensuring-reproducible-builds-with-the-cargolock-file">Ensuring Reproducible Builds with the Cargo.lock File</a></h4>
<p>Cargo has a mechanism that ensures you can rebuild the same artifact every time you or anyone else builds your code: Cargo will use only the versions of the dependencies you specified until you indicate otherwise. For example, say that next week version 0.8.6 of the <code>rand</code> crate comes out, and that version contains an important bug fix, but it also contains a regression that will break your code. To handle this, Rust creates the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file the first time you run <code>cargo build</code>, so we now have this in the <code>guessing_game</code> directory.</p>
<p>When you build a project for the first time, Cargo figures out all the versions of the dependencies that fit the criteria and then writes them to the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file. When you build your project in the future, Cargo will see that the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file exists and will use the versions specified there rather than doing all the work of figuring out versions again. This lets you have a reproducible build automatically. In other words, your project will remain at 0.8.5 until you explicitly upgrade, thanks to the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file. Because the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file is important for reproducible builds, it's often checked into source control with the rest of the code in your project.</p>
<h4 id="updating-a-crate-to-get-a-new-version"><a class="header" href="#updating-a-crate-to-get-a-new-version">Updating a Crate to Get a New Version</a></h4>
<p>When you do want to update a crate, Cargo provides the command <code>update</code>, which will ignore the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file and figure out all the latest versions that fit your specifications in <code>Cargo.toml</code>. Cargo will then write those versions to the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file. Otherwise, by default, Cargo will only look for versions greater than 0.8.5 and less than 0.9.0.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to say about Cargo and its ecosystem, which we'll discuss in Chapter 14, but for now, that's all we need to know. Cargo makes it very easy to reuse libraries, so Rustaceans are able to write smaller projects that are assembled from a number of packages.</p>

<p>First we add the line <code>use rand::Rng;</code>(1).
The <code>Rng</code> trait defines methods that random number generators implement,
and this trait must be in scope for ust to use those methods.
Chapter 10 will cover traits in detail.</p>
<p>Next, we're adding two lines in the middle.
In the first line (2),
we call the <code>rand::thread_rng</code> function that gives us the particular random number generator we're going to use:
one that is local to the current thread of execution and is seeded by the operating system.
Then we call the <code>gen_range</code> method on the random number generator.
This method is defined by the <code>Rng</code> trait that we brought into scope with the <code>use rand::Rng;</code> statement.
The <code>gen_range</code> method takes a range expression as an argument and generates a random number in the rage.
The kind of range expression we're using here takes the from
<code>start..=end</code> and is inclusive on the lower and upper bounds,
so we need to specify <code>1..=100</code> to request a number between 1 and 100.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You won't just know which traits to use and which methods and functions to call from a crate, so each crate has documentation with instructions for using it. Another neat feature of Cargo is that running the <code>cargo doc --open</code> command will build documentation provided by all your dependencies locally and open it in your browser. If you're interested in other functionality in the <code>rand</code> crate, for example, run <code>cargo doc --open</code> and click <code>rand</code> in the sidebar on the left.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second new line (3) prints the secret number.
This is useful while we're developing the program to be able to test it, but we'll delete it from the final version.
It's not much of a game if the program prints the answer as soon as it starts!</p>

<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>First we add another <code>use</code> statement (1),
bringing a type called <code>std::cmp::Ordering</code> into scope from the standard library.
The <code>Ordering</code> type is another enum and has the variants <code>Less</code>, <code>Greater</code>, and <code>Equal</code>.
These are the three outcomes that are possible when you compare two values.</p>
<p>Then we add five new lines at the bottom that use the <code>Ordering</code> type.
The <code>cmp</code> method (3) compares two values and can be called on anything that can be compared.
It takes a reference to whatever you want to compare with: here it's comparing <code>guess</code> to <code>secret_number</code>.
Then it returns a variant of the <code>Ordering</code> enum we brought into scope with the <code>use</code> statement.
We use a <code>match</code> expression (2)
to decide what to do next based on which variant of <code>Ordering</code> was returned from the call to <code>cmp</code> with the values in <code>guess</code> and <code>secret_number</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>match</code> expression is made up of arms.
An arm consists of a pattern to match against,
and the code that should be run if the value given to <code>match</code> fits that arm's pattern.
Rust takes the value given to <code>match</code> and looks through each arm's pattern in turn.
Patterns and the <code>match</code> construct are powerful Rust features:
they let you express a variety of situations your code might encounter and they make sure you handle them all.
These features will be covered in detail in Chapter 6 and Chapter 18, respectively.</p>
<p>Let's walk through an example with the <code>match</code> expression we use here. Say that the user has guessed 50 and the randomly generated secret number this time is 38.</p>
<p>When the code compares 50 to 38, the <code>cmp</code> method will return <code>Ordering::Greater</code> because 50 is greater than 38. The <code>match</code> expression gets the <code>Ordering::Greater</code> value and starts checking each arm's pattern. It looks at the first arm's pattern, <code>Ordering::Less</code>, and sees that the value <code>Ordering::Greater</code> does not match <code>Ordering::Less</code>, so it ignores the code in that arm and moves to the next arm. The next arm's pattern is <code>Ordering::Greater</code>, which does match <code>Ordering::Greater</code>! The associated code in that arm will execute and print <code>Too big!</code> to the screen. The <code>match</code> expression ends after the first successful match, so it won't look at the last arm in this scenario. However, the code won't compile yet.</p>

error: could not compile `guessing_game` due to previous error
</code></pre>
<p>The core of the error states that there are mismatched types. Rust has a strong, static type system. However, it also has type inference. When we wrote <code>let mut guess = String::new()</code>, Rust was able to infer that <code>guess</code> should be a <code>String</code> and didn't make us write the type. The <code>secret_number</code>, on the other hand, is a number type. A few of Rust's number types can have a value between 1 and 100: <code>i32</code>, a 32-bit number; <code>u32</code>, an unsigned 32-bit number; <code>i64</code>, a 64-bit number; as well as others. Unless otherwise specified, Rust defaults to an <code>i32</code>, which is the type of <code>secret_number</code> unless you add type information elsewhere that would cause Rust to infer a different numerical type. The reason for the error is that Rust cannot compare a string and a number type.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we want to convert the <code>String</code> the program reads as input into a real number type so we can compare it numerically to the secret number. We do so by adding this line to the <code>main</code> function body:</p>

<p>We create a variable named <code>guess</code>. But wait, doesn't the program already have a variable named <code>guess</code>? It does but helpfully Rust allows us to shadow the previous value of <code>guess</code> with a new one. Shadowing lets us reuse the <code>guess</code> variable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables, such as <code>guess_str</code> and <code>guess</code>, for example. We'll cover this in more detail in Chapter 3, but for now, know that this feature is often used when you want to conver a value from one type to another type.</p>
<p>We bind this new variable to the expression <code>guess.trim().parse()</code>. The <code>guess</code> in the expression refers to the original <code>guess</code> variable that contained the input as a string. The <code>trim</code> method on a <code>String</code> instance will eliminate any whitespace at the beginning and end, which we must do to be able to compare the string to the <code>u32</code>, which can only contain numerical data. The user must press ENTER to satisfy <code>read_line</code> and input their guess, which adds a newline character to the string. For example, if the user types 5 and presses ENTER, <code>guess</code> looks like this: <code>5\n</code>. The <code>\n</code> represents &quot;newline.&quot; (On Windows, pressing ENTER results in a carriage return and a newline, <code>\r\n</code>.) The <code>trim</code> method eliminates <code>\n</code> or <code>\r\n</code>, resulting in just 5.</p>
<p>The <code>parse</code> method on strings converts a string to another type. Here, we use it to convert from a string to a number. We need to tell Rust the exact number type we want by using <code>let guess: u32</code>. The colon (<code>:</code>) after <code>guess</code> tells Rust we'll annotate the variable's type. Rust has a few built-in number types; the <code>u32</code> seen here is an unsigned, 32-bit integer. It's a good default choice for a small positive number. You'll learn about other number types in Chapter 3.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <code>u32</code> annotation in this example program and the comparison with <code>secret_number</code> means Rust will infer that <code>secret_number</code> should be a <code>u32</code> as well. So now the comparison will be between two values of the same type!</p>
<p>The <code>parse</code> method will only work on characters that can logically be converted into numbers and so can easily cause errors. If, for example, the string contained <code>A👍%</code>, there would be no way to convert that to a number. Because it might fail, the <code>parse</code> method returns a <code>Result</code> type, much as the <code>read_line</code> method does (discussed earlier in &quot;Handling Potential Failure with Result&quot;). We'll treat this <code>Result</code> the same way by using the <code>expect</code> method again. If <code>parse</code> returns an <code>Err Result</code> variant because it couldn't create a number from the string, the <code>expect</code> call will crash the game and print the message we give it. If <code>parse</code> can successfully convert the string to a number, it will return the <code>Ok</code> variant of <code>Result</code>, and <code>expect</code> will return the number that we want from the <code>Ok</code> value.</p>

<p>Nice! Even though spaces were added before the guess, the program still figured out that the user guessed 77.

<p>As you can see, we've moved everything from the guess input prompt onward into a loop.
Be sure to indent the lines inside the loop another four spaces each and run the program again. The program will now ask for another guess forever, which actually introduces a new problem.
It doesn't seem like the user can quit!</p>
<p>The user could always interrupt the program by using the keyboard shortcut CTRL-C. But there's another way to escape this insatiable monster as mentioned in the <code>parse</code> discussion in &quot;Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number&quot;: if the user enters a non-number answer, the program will crash. We can take advantage of that to allow the user to quit, as shown here:</p>

<p>We switch from an <code>expect</code> call to a <code>match</code> expression to move from crashing on an error to handling the error. Remember that <code>parse</code> returns a <code>Result</code> type and <code>Result</code> is an enum that has the variants <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code>. We're using a <code>match</code> expression here, as we did with the <code>Ordering</code> result of the <code>cmp</code> method.</p>
<p>If <code>parse</code> is able to successfully turn the string into a number, it will return an <code>Ok</code> value that contains the resultant number. That <code>Ok</code> value will match the first arm's pattern, and the <code>match</code> expression will just return the <code>num</code> value that <code>parse</code> produced and put inside the <code>Ok</code> value. That number will end up right where we want it in the new <code>guess</code> variable we're creating.</p>
<p>If <code>parse</code> is not able to turn the string into a number, it will return an <code>Err</code> value that contains more information about the error. The <code>Err</code> value does not match the <code>Ok(num)</code> pattern in the first <code>match</code> arm, but it does match the <code>Err(_)</code> pattern in the second arm. The underscore, <code>_</code>, is a catch-all value; in this example, we're saying we want to match all <code>Err</code> values, no matter what information they have inside them. So the program will execute the second arm's code, <code>continue</code>, which tells the program to go to the next iteration of the <code>loop</code> and ask for another guess. So, effectively, the program ignores all errors that <code>parse</code> might encounter!</p>

<p>Awesome! With one tiny final tweak, we will finight the guessing game.
Recall that the program is still printing the secret number. That worked well for testing, but it ruins the game. Let's delete the <code>println!</code> that outputs the secret number.</p>
<p>final code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use rand::Rng;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);

    loop {
        println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);

        let mut guess = String::new();

        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
            .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);

        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) =&gt; num,
            Err(_) =&gt; continue,
        };

        println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);

        match guess.cmp(&amp;secret_number) {

            Ordering::Greater =&gt; println!(&quot;Too big!&quot;),
            Ordering::Equal =&gt; {
                println!(&quot;You win!&quot;);

<h2 id="summary-1"><a class="header" href="#summary-1">Summary</a></h2>
<p>This project was a hands-on way to introduce you to many new Rust concepts: <code>let</code>, <code>match</code>, functions, the use of external crates, and more. In the next few chapters, you'll learn about these concepts in more detail. Chapter 3 covers concepts that most programming languages have, such as variables, data types, and functions, and shows how to use them in Rust. Chapter 4 explores ownership, a feature that makes Rust different from other languages. Chapter 5 discusses structs and method syntax, and Chapter 6 explains how enums work.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="common-programming-concepts"><a class="header" href="#common-programming-concepts">Common Programming Concepts</a></h1>
<p>This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming language and how they work in Rust.
Many programming languages have much in common at their core.
None of the concepts presented in this chapter are unique to Rust, but we'll discuss them in the context of Rust and
explain the conventions around using these concepts.</p>
<p>Specifically, you'll learn about variables, basic types, functions, comments, and control flow.
These foundations will be in every Rust program, and learning them early will give you a strong core to start from.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="keywords"><a class="header" href="#keywords">Keywords</a></h4>
<p>The Rust language has a set of keywords that are reserved for use by the language only, much as in other languages.
Keep in mind that you cannot use these words as names of variables or functions. Most of the keywords have special
meanings, and you'll be using them to do various tasks in your Rst programs; a few have no current functionality
associated with them but have been reserved for functionality that might be added to Rust in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="variables-and-mutability"><a class="header" href="#variables-and-mutability">Variables and Mutability</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned in &quot;Storing Values with Variables&quot;, by default, variables are immutable. This is one of many nudges Rust
gives you to write your code in a way that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that Rust offers. However,
you still have the option to make your variables mutable. Let's explore how and why Rust encourages you to favor
immutability and why sometimes you might want to opt out.</p>
<p>When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can't change that value. To illustrate this, generate
a new project called variables in your projects directory by using <code>cargo new variables</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
    x = 6;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Save and run the program using <code>cargo run</code>. You should receive an error message regarding an immutability error, as
shown in this output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
 --&gt; src\main.rs:4:5
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         -
  |         |
  |         first assignment to `x`
  |         help: consider making this binding mutable: `mut x`
3 |     println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
4 |     x = 6;
  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
</code></pre>
<p>This example shows how the compiler helps you find errors in your programs. Compiler errors can be frustrating, but
really they only mean your program isn't safely doing what you want it to do yet; they do not mean that you're not a
good programmer! Experienced Rustaceans still get compiler errors.</p>
<p>You received the error message <code>cannot assign twice to immutable variable 'x'</code> because you tried to assign a second
value to the immutable <code>x</code> variable. It's important that we get compile-time errors when we attempt to change a value
that's designated as immutable because this very situation can lead to bugs. If one part of our code operates on the
assumption that a value will never change and another part of our code changes that value, it's possible that the first
part of the code won't do what it was designed to do. The cause of this kind of bug can be difficult to track down after
the fact, especially when the second piece of code changes the value only sometimes. The Rust compiler guarantees that
when you state that a value won't change, it really won't change, so you don't have to keep track of it yourself. Your
code is thus easier to reason through.</p>
<p>But mutability can be very useful, and can make code more convenient to write. Although variables are immutable by
default, you can make them mutable by adding <code>mut</code> in front of the variable name as you did in Chapter 2.</p>
<p>Adding <code>mut</code> also conveys intent to future readers of the code by indicating that other parts of the code will be
changing this variable's value.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
    x = 6;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We're allowed to change the value bound to <code>x</code> from 5 to 6 when <code>mut</code> is used. Ultimately, deciding whether to use
mutability or ot is up to you and depends on what you think is clearest in that particular situation.</p>
<h3 id="constants"><a class="header" href="#constants">Constants</a></h3>
<p>Like immutable variables, constants are values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change, but there are a
few differences between constants and variables.</p>
<p>First, you aren't allowed to use <code>mut</code> with constants. Constants aren't just immutable by default — they're always
immutable. You declare constants using the <code>const</code> keyword instead of the <code>let</code> keyword, and the type of the value must
be annotated. We'll cover types and type annotations in &quot;Data Types&quot; soon. Just know that you must always annotate the
type.</p>
<p>Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes them useful for values that many parts
of code need to know about.</p>
<p>The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could
only be computed at runtime.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a constant declaration:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The constant's name is <code>THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS</code> and its value is set to the result of multiplying 60 (the number of
seconds in a minute) by 60 (the number of minutes in an hour) by 3 (the number of hours we want to count in this
program). Rust's naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words. The compiler is
able to evaluate a limited set of operations at compile time, which lets us choose to write out this value in a way
that's easier to understand and verify, rather than setting this constant to the value 10,800.
See the Rust Reference's section on constant evaluation at (https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/const_eval.html) for
more information on what operations can be used when declaring constants.</p>
<p>Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope in which they were declared. This property
makes constants useful for values in your application domain that multiple parts of the program might need to know
about, such as the maximum number of points any player of a game is allowed to earn, or the speed of light.</p>
<p>Naming hardcoded values used throughout your program as constants is useful in conveying the meaning of that value to
future maintainers of the code. It also helps to have only one place in your code you would need to change if the
hardcoded value needed to be updated in the future.</p>
<h3 id="shadowing"><a class="header" href="#shadowing">Shadowing</a></h3>
<p>As you saw in the guessing game tutorial in Chapter 2, you can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous
variable. Rustaceans say that the first variable is shadowed by the second, which means that the second variable is what
the compiler will see when you use the name of the variable. In effect, the second variable overshadows the first,
taking any uses of the variable name to itself until either it itself is shadowed or the scope ends. We can shadow a
variable by using the same variable's name and repeating the use of the <code>let</code> keyword as follows:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!(&quot;The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}&quot;);
    }

    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This program first binds <code>x</code> to a value of 5. Then it creates a new variable <code>x</code> by repeating <code>let x =</code>, taking the
original value and adding 1 so the value of <code>x</code> is then 6. Then within an inner scope created with the curly brackets,
the third <code>let statement also shadows </code>x<code>and creates a new variable, multiplying the previous value by 2 to give</code>
x<code>a value of 12. When that scope is over, the inner shadowing ends and</code>x` returns to being 6. When we run this
program, it will output the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
   Compiling shadowing v0.1.0 (C:\Users\jerok\projects\study_blog\rust_lang_book\code\ch03\shadowing)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.38s                                                            
     Running `target\debug\shadowing.exe`
The value of x in the inner scope is: 12
The value of x is: 6
</code></pre>
<p>Shadowing is different from marking a variable as <code>mut</code> because we'll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to
reassign to this variable without using the <code>let</code> keyword. By using <code>let</code>, we can perform a few transformations on a
value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.</p>
<p>The other difference between <code>mut</code> and shadowing is that because we're effectively creating a new variable when we use
the <code>let</code> keyword again, we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name. For example, say our program asks
a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by inputting space characters, and then we want to store that
input as a number:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let spaces = &quot;   &quot;;
    let spaces = spaces.len();
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>The first <code>spaces</code> variable is a string type and the second <code>spaces</code> variable is a number type. Shadowing thus spares us
from having to come up with different names, such as <code>spaces_str</code> and <code>spaces_num</code>; instead, we can reuse the
simpler <code>spaces</code> name. However, if we try to use <code>mut</code> for this, as shown here, we'll get a compile-time error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut spaces = &quot;   &quot;;
    spaces = spaces.len();
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>The error says we're not allowed to mutate a variable's type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --&gt; src\main.rs:15:14
   |
14 |     let mut spaces = &quot;   &quot;;
   |                      ----- expected due to this value
15 |     spaces = spaces.len();
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `&amp;str`, found `usize`
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we've explored how variables work, lt's look at more data types they can have.</p>
<h2 id="data-types"><a class="header" href="#data-types">Data Types</a></h2>
<p>Every value in Rust is of a certain data type, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to
work with that data. We'll look at two data type subsets: scalar and compound.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Rust is statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile
time. The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it. In cases when many
types are possible, such as when we converted a <code>String</code> to a numeric type using <code>parse</code> in &quot;Comparing the Guess to the
Secret Number&quot;, we must add a type annotation, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let guess: u32 = &quot;42&quot;.parse().expect(&quot;Not a number!&quot;);</code></pre>
<p>If we don't add the <code>: u32</code> type annotation shown in the preceiding code, Rust will display the following error, which
means the compiler needs more information from us to know which type we want to use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0282]: type annotations needed
 --&gt; src\main.rs:2:9
  |
2 |     let guess = &quot;42&quot;.parse().expect(&quot;Not a number!&quot;);
  |         ^^^^^
  |
help: consider giving `guess` an explicit type
  |
2 |     let guess: _ = &quot;42&quot;.parse().expect(&quot;Not a number!&quot;);
  |              +++
</code></pre>
<p>You'll see different type annotations for other data types.</p>
<h3 id="scalar-types"><a class="header" href="#scalar-types">Scalar Types</a></h3>
<p>A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans,
and characters. You may recognize these from other programming languages. Let's jump into how they work in Rust.</p>
<h4 id="integer-types"><a class="header" href="#integer-types">Integer Types</a></h4>
<p>An integer is a number without a fractional component. We used one integer type in Chapter 2, the <code>u32</code> type. This type
declaration indicates that the value it's associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types starts
with <code>i</code> instead of <code>u</code>) that takes up 32 bits of space. Table shows the built-in integer types is Rust. We can use any
of these variants to declare the type of an integer value.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Length</th><th>Signed</th><th>Unsigned</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>8-bit</td><td><code>i8</code></td><td><code>u8</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>16-bit</td><td><code>i16</code></td><td><code>u16</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>32-bit</td><td><code>i32</code></td><td><code>u32</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>64-bit</td><td><code>i64</code></td><td><code>u64</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>128-bit</td><td><code>i128</code></td><td><code>u128</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>arch</td><td><code>isize</code></td><td><code>usize</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size. Signed and unsigned refer to whether it's
possible for the number to be negative - in other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it (signed) or
whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be represented without a sign (unsigned). It's like writing
numbers on paper: when the sign matters, a number is shown with a plus sign or a minus sign; however, when it's safe to
assume the number is positive, it's shown with no sign. Signed numbers are stored using two's complement representation.</p>
<p>Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2<sup>n-1</sup>) to 2<sup>n-1</sup>-1 inclusive, where n is the number of
bits that variant uses. So an <code>i8</code> can store numbers from -(2<sup>7</sup>) to 2<sup>7</sup>-1, which equals -128 to 127.
Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup>-1, so a <code>u8</code> can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>8</sup>-1,
which equals 0 to 255.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <code>isize</code> and <code>usize</code> types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on, which
is denoted in the table as &quot;arch&quot;: 64 bits if you're on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you're on a 32-bit
architecture.</p>
<p>You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in the Table. Note that number literals that can be multiple
numeric types allow a type suffix, such as <code>57u8</code>, to designate the type. Number literals can also use <code>_</code> as a visual
separator to make the number easier to read, such as <code>1_000</code>, which will have the same value as if you had
specified <code>1000</code>.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Number literals</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Decimal</td><td>98_222</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hex</td><td>0xff</td></tr>
<tr><td>Octal</td><td>0o77</td></tr>
<tr><td>Binary</td><td>0b1111_0000</td></tr>
<tr><td>Byte (<code>u8</code> only)</td><td>b'A'</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>So how do you know which type of integer to use? If you're unsure, Rust's defaults are generally good places to start:
integer types default to <code>i32</code>. The primary situation in which you'd use <code>isize</code> or <code>usize</code> is when indexing some sort
of collection.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="integer-overflow"><a class="header" href="#integer-overflow">Integer Overflow</a></h4>
<p>Let's say you have a variable of type <code>u8</code> that can hold values between 0 and 255. If you try to change the variable
to a value outside that range, such as 256, integer overflow will occur, which can result in one of two behaviors.
When
you're compiling in debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow that cause your program to panic at runtime
if
this behavior occurs. Rust uses the term panicking when a program exits with an error; we'll discuss panics in more
depth in &quot;Unrecoverable Errors with panic!&quot;.</p>
<p>When you're compiling in release mode with the <code>--release</code> flag, Rust does not include checks for integer overflow
that cause panics. Instead, if overflow occurs, Rust performs two's complement wrapping. In short, values greater than
the maximum value the type can hold &quot;wrap around&quot; to the minimum of the values the type can hold. In the case of
a <code>u8</code>,
the value 256 becomes 0, the value 257 becomes 1, and so on. The program won't panic, but the variable will have a
value
that probably isn't what you were expecting it to have. Relying on integer overflow's wrapping behavior is considered
an
error.</p>
<p>To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use these families of methods provided by the standard
library for primitive numeric types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrap in all modes with the <code>wrapping_*</code> methods, such as <code>wrapping_add</code>.</li>
<li>Return the <code>None</code> value if there is overflow with the <code>checked_*</code> methods.</li>
<li>Return the value and a Boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the <code>overflowing_*</code> methods.</li>
<li>Saturate at the value's minimum or maximum values with the <code>saturating_*</code> methods.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="floating-point-types"><a class="header" href="#floating-point-types">Floating-Point Types</a></h4>
<p>Rust also has two primitive types for floating-point numbers, which are numbers with decimal points. Rust's
floating-point types are <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code>, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is <code>f64</code>
because on modern CPUs, it's roughly the same speed as <code>f32</code> but is capable of more precision. All floating-point types
are signed.</p>
<p>Here's an example that shows floating-point numbers in action:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let x = 2.0;  // f64
    
    let y: f32 = 3.0;  // f32
}</code></pre>
<p>Floating_point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The <code>f32</code> type is a single-precision float,
and <code>f64</code> has double precision.</p>
<h4 id="numeric-operations"><a class="header" href="#numeric-operations">Numeric Operations</a></h4>
<p>Rust supports the basic mathematical operations you'd expect for all the number types: addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and remainder. Integer division truncates toward zero to the nearest integer. The following
code shows how you'd use each numeric operation in a <code>let</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;
    
    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;
    
    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;
    
    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3;  // Results in -1
    
    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}</code></pre>
<p>Each expression in these statements uses a mathematical operator and evaluates to a single value, which is then bound to
a variable. Appendix B contains a list of all operators that Rust provides.</p>
<h4 id="the-boolean-type"><a class="header" href="#the-boolean-type">The Boolean Type</a></h4>
<p>As in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible values: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. Booleans are
one byte in size. The Boolean type in Rust is specified using <code>bool</code>. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let t = true;
    
    let f: bool = false;  // with explicit type annotation
}</code></pre>
<p>The main way to use Boolean values is through conditionals, such as an <code>if</code> expression. We'll cover how <code>if</code> expressions
work in Rust in &quot;Control Flow&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="the-character-type"><a class="header" href="#the-character-type">The Character Type</a></h4>
<p>Rust's <code>char</code> type is the language's most primitive alphabetic type. Here are some examples of declaring <code>char</code> values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = 'Z';  // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = '😻';
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that we specify <code>char</code> literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes.
Rust's <code>char</code> type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode scalar value, which means it can represent a lot more
than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all
valid <code>char</code> values in Rust. Unicode scalar values range from <code>U+0000</code> to <code>U+D7FF</code> and <code>U+E000</code> to <code>U+10FFFF</code> inclusive.
However, a &quot;character&quot; isn't really a concept in Unicode, so your haman intuition for what a &quot;character&quot; is may not
match up with what a <code>char</code> is in Rust. We'll discuss this topic in detail in &quot;Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="compound-types"><a class="header" href="#compound-types">Compound Types</a></h3>
<p>Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.</p>
<h4 id="the-tuple-type"><a class="header" href="#the-tuple-type">The Tuple Type</a></h4>
<p>A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples
have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.</p>
<p>We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type,
and the types of the different values in the tuple don't have to be the same. We've added optional type annotations in
this example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>tup</code> binds to the entire tuple because a tuple is considered a single compound element. To get the
individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
    
    let (x, y, z) = tup;
    
    println!(&quot;The value of y is: {y}&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<p>This program first creates a tuple and binds it to the variable <code>tup</code>. It then uses a pattern with <code>let</code> to take <code>tup</code>
and turn it into three separate variables, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>. This is called destructuring because it breaks the single
tuple into three parts. Finally, the program prints the value of <code>y</code>, which is 6.4.</p>
<p>We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (<code>.</code>) followed by the index of the value we want to
access. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    
    let five_hundred = x.0;
    let six_point_four = x.1;
    let one = x.2;
}</code></pre>
<p>This program creates the tuple <code>x</code> and then accesses each element of the tuple using their respective indices. As with
most programming languages, the first index in a tuple is 0.</p>
<p>The tuple without any values has a special name, unit. This value and its corresponding type are both written <code>()</code> and
represent an empty value or an empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don't return any
other value.</p>
<h4 id="the-array-type"><a class="header" href="#the-array-type">The Array Type</a></h4>
<p>Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an array. Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must
have the same type. Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.</p>
<p>We write the values in an array as a comma-separated list inside square brackets:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}</code></pre>
<p>Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap (we will discuss the stack and the
heap more in Chapter 4) or when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements. An array isn't as
flexible as the vector type, though. A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that is
allowed to grow or shrink in size. If you're unsure whether to use an array or a vector, chances are you should use a
vector. Chapter 8 discusses vectors in more detail.</p>
<p>However, arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements will not need to change. For example, if you were
using the names of the month in the program, you would probably use an array rather than a vector because you know it
will always contain 12 elements:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let months = [&quot;January&quot;, &quot;February&quot;, &quot;March&quot;, &quot;April&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;June&quot;, &quot;July&quot;,
&quot;August&quot;, &quot;September&quot;, &quot;October&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;December&quot;];</code></pre>
<p>You write an array's type using square brackets with the type of each element, a semicolon, and then the number of
elements in the array, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>i32</code> is the type of each element. After the semicolon, the number 5 indicates the array contains five elements.</p>
<p>You can also initialize an array to contain the same value for each element by specifying the initial value, followed by
a semicolon, and then the length of the array in square brackets, as shown here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let a = [3; 5];</code></pre>
<p>The array named <code>a</code> will contain 5 elements that will all be set to the value 3 initially. This is the same as
writing <code>let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];</code> but in a more concise way.</p>
<h4 id="accessing-array-elements"><a class="header" href="#accessing-array-elements">Accessing Array Elements</a></h4>
<p>An array is a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can be allocated on the stack. You can access elements
of an array using indexing, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the variable named <code>first</code> will get the value 1 because that is the value at index <code>[0]</code> in the array.
The variable named <code>second</code> will get the value 2 from index <code>[1]</code> in the array.</p>
<h4 id="invalid-array-element-access"><a class="header" href="#invalid-array-element-access">Invalid Array Element Access</a></h4>
<p>Let's see what happens if you try to access an element of an array that is past the end of the array. Say you run this
code, similar to the guessing game in Chapter 2, to get an array index from the user:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">use std::io;

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    println!(&quot;Please enter an array index.&quot;);

    let mut index = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut index)
        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);

    let index: usize = index
        .trim()
        .parse()
        .expect(&quot;Index entered was not a number&quot;);

    let element = a[index];

    println!(
        &quot;The value of the element at index {index} is: {element}&quot;
    );
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This code compiles successfully. If you run this code using <code>cargo run</code> and enter 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, the program will
print out the corresponding value at that index in the array. If you instead enter a number past the end of the array,
such as 10, you'll see output like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10', src\main.rs:19:19
note: Some details are omitted, run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` for a verbose backtrace.
</code></pre>
<p>The program resulted in a runtime error at the point of using an invalid value in the indexing operation. The program
exited with an error message and didn't execute the final <code>println!</code> statement. When you attempt to access an element
using indexing, Rust will check that the index you've specified is less than the array length. If the index is greater
than or equal to the length, Rust will panic. This check has to happen at runtime, especially in this case, because the
compiler can't possibly know what value a user will enter when they run the code later.</p>
<p>This is an example of Rust's memory safety principles in action. In many low-level languages, this kind of check is not
done, and when you provide an incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed. Rust protects you against this kind of
error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory access and continuing. Chapter 9 discusses more of Rust's
error handling and how you can write readable, safe code that neither panics nor allows invalid memory access.</p>
<h2 id="functions"><a class="header" href="#functions">Functions</a></h2>
<p>Functions are prevalent in Rust code. You've already seen one of the most important functions in the language:
the <code>main</code> function, which is the entry point of many programs. You've also seen the <code>fn</code> keyword, which allows you to
declare new functions.</p>
<p>Rust code uses snake case as the conventional style for function and variable names, in which all letters are lowercase
and underscores separate words. Here's a program that contains an example function definition:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!(&quot;Another function&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We define a function in Rust by entering <code>fn</code> followed by a function name and a set of parentheses. The curly brackets
tell the compiler where the function body begins and ends.</p>
<p>We can call any function we've defined by entering its name followed by a set of parentheses. Because <code>another_function</code>
is defined in the program, it can be called from inside the <code>main</code> function. Note that we defined <code>another_function</code>
after the <code>main</code> function in the source code; we could have defined it before as well. Rust doesn't care where you
define your functions, only that they're defined somewhere in a scope that can be seen by the caller.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The lines execute in the order in which they appear in the <code>main</code> function. First the &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message prints,
and then <code>another_function</code> is called and its message is printed.</p>
<h3 id="parameters"><a class="header" href="#parameters">Parameters</a></h3>
<p>We can define functions to have parameters, which are special variables that are part of a function's signature. When a
function has parameters, you can provide it with concrete values for those parameters. Technically, the concrete values
are called arguments, but in casual conversion, people tend to use the words parameter and argument interchangeably for
either the variables in a function's definition or the concrete values passed in when you call a function.</p>
<p>In this version of <code>another_function</code> we add a parameter:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.08s
     Running `target\debug\functions.exe`
The value of x is: 5
</code></pre>
<p>The declaration of <code>another_function</code> has one parameter named <code>x</code>. The type of <code>x</code> is specified as <code>i32</code>. When we pass 5
in to <code>another_function</code>, the <code>println!</code> macro puts 5 where the pair of curly brackets containing <code>x</code> was in the format
string.</p>
<p>In function signatures, you must declare the type of each parameter. This is a deliberate decision in Rust's design:
requiring type annotations in function definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in
the code to figure out what type you mean. The compiler is also able to give more helpful error messages if it knows
what types the function expects.</p>
<p>When defining multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations with commas, like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    print_labeled_measurement(5, 'h');
}

fn print_labeled_measurement(value: i32, unit_label: char) {
    println!(&quot;The measurement is: {value}{unit_label}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This example creates a function named <code>print_labeled_measurement</code> with two parameters. The first parameter is
named <code>value</code> and is an <code>i32</code>. The second is named <code>unit_label</code> and is type <code>char</code>. The function then prints text
containing both the <code>value</code> and the <code>unit_label</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.09s
     Running `target\debug\functions.exe`
The measurement is: 5h
</code></pre>
<p>Because we called the function with 5 as the value for <code>value</code> and <code>h</code> as the value for <code>unit_label</code>, the program output
contains those values.</p>
<h3 id="statements-and-expressions"><a class="header" href="#statements-and-expressions">Statements and Expressions</a></h3>
<p>Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression. So far, the functions we've
covered haven't included an ending expression, but you have seen an expression as part of a statement. Because Rust is
an expression-based language, this is an important distinction to understand. Other languages don't have the same
distinctions, so let's look at what statements and expressions are and how their differences affect the bodies of
functions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.</li>
<li>Expressions evaluate to a resultant value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at some examples.</p>
<p>We've actually already used statements and expressions. Creating a variable and assigning a value to it with the <code>let</code>
keyword is a statement.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let y = 6;
}</code></pre>
<p>Function definitions are also statements; the entire preceding example is a statement in itself.</p>
<p>Statements do not return values. Therefore, you can't assign a <code>let</code> statement to another variable, as the following
code tries to do; you'll get an error:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let x = (let y = 6);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>When you run this program, the error you'll get looks like this:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The <code>let y = 6</code> statement does not return a value, so there isn't anything for <code>x</code> to bind to. This is different from
what happens in other languages, where the assignment returns the value of the assignment. In other languages, you can
write <code>x = y = 6</code> and have both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have the value 6; that is not the case in Rust.</p>
<p>Expressions evaluate to a value and make up most of the rest of the code that you'll write in Rust. Consider a math
operation, such as 5 + 6, which is an expression that evaluates to the value 11. Expressions can be part of statements:
the 6 in the statement <code>let y = 6;</code> is an expression that evaluates to the value 6. Calling a function is an expression.
Calling a macro is an expression. A new scope block created with curly brackets is an expression, for example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let y = {       // 1, 2
        let x = 3;
        x + 1       // 3
    };
    
    println!(&quot;The value of y is: {y}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The expression (2) is a block that, in this case, evaluates to 4. That value gets bound to <code>y</code> as part of the <code>let</code>
statement (1). Note the line without a semicolon at the end (3), which is unlike most of the lines you've seen so fat.
Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a
statement, and it will then not return a value. Keep this in mind as you explore function return values and expressions
next.</p>
<h3 id="functions-with-return-values"><a class="header" href="#functions-with-return-values">Functions with Return Values</a></h3>
<p>Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We don't name return values, but we must declare their type
after an arrow (<code>-&gt;</code>). In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in
the block of the body of a function. You can return early from a function by using the <code>return</code> keyword and specifying a
value, but most functions return the last expression implicitly. Here's an example of a function that returns a value:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn five() -&gt; i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();
    
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>There are no function calls, macros, or even <code>let</code> statements in the <code>five</code> function - just the number 5 by itself.
That's a perfectly valid function in Rust. Note that the function's return type is specified too, as <code>-&gt; i32</code>. Try
running this code; the output should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run

     Running `target\debug\functions.exe`
The value of x is: 5
</code></pre>
<p>The 5 in <code>five</code> is the function's return value, which is why the return type is <code>i32</code>. Let's examine this in more
detail. There are two important bits: first the line <code>let x = five();</code> shows that we're using the return values of a
function to initialize a variable. Because the function <code>five</code> returns a 5, that line is the same as the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let x = 5;</code></pre>
<p>Second, the <code>five</code> function has no parameters and defines the type of the return value, but the body of the functions is
a lonely 5 with no semicolon because it's an expression whose value we want to return.</p>
<p>Let's look at another example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    x + 1
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Running this code will printing <code>The value of x is: 6</code>. But if we place a semicolon at the end of the line
containing <code>x + 1</code>, changing it from an expression to a statement, we'll get an error:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);

<p>The main error message, <code>mismatched types</code>, reveals the core issue with this code. The definition of the
function <code>plus_one</code> says that it will return an <code>i32</code>, but statements don't evaluate to a value, which is expressed

which would fix the error.</p>
<h2 id="commnets"><a class="header" href="#commnets">Commnets</a></h2>
<p>All programmers strive to make their code easy to understand but sometimes extra explanation is warranted. In these
cases, programmers leave
comments in their source code that the compiler will ignore but people reading the source code may find useful.
Here’s a simple comment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">// hello, world</code></pre>
<p>In Rust, the idiomatic comment style starts a comment with two slashes,
and the comment continues until the end of the line. For comments that
extend beyond a single line, you’ll need to include <code>//</code> on each line, like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// So we're doing something complicated here, long enough that we need
// multiple lines of comments to do it! Whew! Hopefully, this comment will
// explain what's going on.
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Comments can also be placed at the end of lines containing code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let lucky_number = 7;  // I'm feeling lucky today
}</code></pre>
<p>But you’ll more often see them used in this format, with the comment
on a separate line above the code it’s annotating:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    // I'm feeling lucky today
    let lucky_number = 7;
}</code></pre>
<p>Rust also has another kind of comment, documentation comments,
which we’ll discuss in “Publishing a Crate to Crates.io”.</p>
<h2 id="control-flow"><a class="header" href="#control-flow">Control Flow</a></h2>
<p>The ability to run some code depending on whether a condition is <code>true</code> and
to run some code repeatedly while a condition is <code>true</code> are basic building
blocks in most programming languages. The most common constructs
that let you control the flow of execution of Rust code are <code>if</code> expressions
and loops.</p>
<h3 id="if-expressions"><a class="header" href="#if-expressions">if Expressions</a></h3>
<p>An <code>if</code> expression allows you to branch your code depending on conditions. You provide a condition and then state, &quot;If
this condition is met, run this block of code. If the condition is not met, do not run this block of code.&quot;</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number &lt; 5 {
        println!(&quot;condition was true&quot;);
    } else {
        println!(&quot;condition was false&quot;);
    }
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>All <code>if</code> expressions start with the keyword <code>if</code>, followed by a condition. In this case, the condition checks whether or
not the variable <code>number</code> has a value less than 5. We place the block of code execute if the condition is <code>true</code>
immediately after the condition inside curly brackets. Blocks of code associated with the conditions in <code>if</code> expressions
are sometimes called arms, just like the arms in <code>match</code> expressions that we discussed in  &quot;Comparing the GUess to the
Secret Number&quot;.</p>
<p>Optionally, we can also include an <code>else</code> expression, which we chose to do here, to give the program an alternative
block of code to execute should the condition evaluate to <code>false</code>. If you don't provide an <code>else</code> expression and the
condition is <code>false</code>, the program will just skip the <code>if</code> block and move on to the next bit of code.</p>
<p>Let's try changing the value of <code>number</code> to a value that makes the condition <code>false</code> to see what happens:</p>

<p>The error indicates that Rust expected a <code>bool</code> but got an integer. Unlike languages such as Ruby and JavaScript, Rust
will not automatically try to convert non-Boolean types to a Boolean. You must be explicit and always provide <code>if</code> with
a Boolean as its condition. If we want the <code>if</code> code block to run only when a number is not equal to 0, for example we
can change the <code>if</code> expression to the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {

<p>When this program executes, it checks each <code>if</code> expression in turn and executes the first body for which the condition
evaluates to <code>true</code>. Note that even though 6 is divisible by 2, we don't see the output <code>number is divisible by 2</code>, nor
do we see the <code>number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2</code> text from the <code>else</code> block. That's because Rust only executes the
block for the first <code>true</code> condition, and once it finds one, it doesn't even check the rest.</p>
<p>Using too many <code>else if</code> expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more than one, you might want to refactor
your code. Chapter 6 describes a powerful Rust branching construct called <code>match</code> for these cases.</p>

<p>The expression in the <code>if</code> block evaluates to an integer, and the expression in the <code>else</code> block evaluates to a string.
This won't work because variables must have a single type, and Rust needs to know at compile time what type
the <code>number variable is, definitively. Knowing the type of </code>
number<code>lets the compiler verify the type is valid everywhere we use</code>
number<code>. Rust wouldn't be able to do that if the type of </code>number` was only determined at runtime; the compiler would be
more complex and would make fewer guarantees about the code if it had to keep track of multiple hypothetical types for
any variable.</p>
<h3 id="repetition-with-loops"><a class="header" href="#repetition-with-loops">Repetition with Loops</a></h3>
<p>It's often useful to execute a block of code more than once. For this task, Rust provides several loops, which will run
through the code inside the loop body to the end and then start immediately back at the beginning.</p>
<p>Rust has three kinds of loops: <code>loop</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>for</code>.</p>
<h4 id="repeating-code-with-loop"><a class="header" href="#repeating-code-with-loop">Repeating Code with loop</a></h4>
<p>The <code>loop</code> keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to
stop.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    loop {
        println!(&quot;again!&quot;);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>When we run this program, we'll see <code>again!</code> printed over and over continuously until we stop the program manually. Most
terminals support the keyboard shortcut CTRL-C to interrupt a program that is stuck in a continual loop.</p>
<p>Rust also provides a way to break out of a loop using code. You can place the <code>break</code> keyword within the loop to tell
the program when to stop executing the loop.</p>
<p>We also used <code>continue</code> in the guessing game, which in a loop tells the program to skip over any remaining code in this
iteration of the loop and go to the next iteration.</p>
<h4 id="returning-values-from-loops"><a class="header" href="#returning-values-from-loops">Returning Values from Loops</a></h4>
<p>One of the uses of a <code>loop</code> is to retry an operation you know might fail, such as checking whether a thread has
completed its job. You might also need to pass the result of that operation out of the loop to the rest of your code. To
do this, you can add the value you want returned after the <code>break</code> expression you use to stop the loop; that value will
be returned out of the loop so you can use it, as shown here:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!(&quot;The result is {result}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Before the loop, we declare a variable named <code>counter</code> and initialize it to 0. Then we declare a variable named <code>result</code>
to hold the value returned from the loop. On every iteration of the loop, we add 1 to the <code>counter</code> variable, and then
check whether the <code>counter</code> is equal to 10. When it is, we use the <code>break</code> keyword with the value <code>counter * 2</code>. After
the loop, we use a semicolon to end the statement that assigns the value to <code>result</code>. Finally, we print the value
in <code>result</code>, which in this case is 20.</p>
<h4 id="loop-labels-to-disambiguate-between-multiple-loops"><a class="header" href="#loop-labels-to-disambiguate-between-multiple-loops">Loop Labels to Disambiguate Between Multiple Loops</a></h4>
<p>If you have loops within loops, <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> apply to the innermost loop at that point. You can optionally
specify a loop label on a loop that you can then use with <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> to specify that those keywords apply to
the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop. Loop labels must begin with a single quote.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!(&quot;count = {count}&quot;);
        let mut remaining = 10;

        loop {
            println!(&quot;remaining = {remaining}&quot;);
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }

        count += 1;
    }
    println!(&quot;End count = {count}&quot;);

remaining = 10
remaining = 9
count = 2
remaining = 10
End count = 2
</code></pre>
<p>Conditional Loops with while</p>
<p>A program will often need to evaluate a condition within a loop. While the condition is <code>true</code>, the loop runs. When the
condition ceases to be <code>true</code>, the program calls <code>break</code>, stopping the loop. It's possible to implement behavior like
this using a combination of <code>loop</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>break</code>; you could try that now in a program, if you'd like.
However, this pattern is so common that Rust has a built-in language construct for it, called a <code>while</code> loop.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!(&quot;{number}!&quot;);

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!(&quot;LIFTOFF!!!&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This construct eliminates a lot of nesting that would be necessary if you used <code>loop</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>break</code>, and
it's clearer. While a condition evaluates to <code>true</code>, the code runs; otherwise, it exits the loop.</p>
<h4 id="looping-through-a-collection-with-for"><a class="header" href="#looping-through-a-collection-with-for">Looping Through a Collection with for</a></h4>
<p>You can choose to use the <code>while</code> construct to loop over the elements of a collection, such as an array.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index &lt; 5 {
        println!(&quot;the value is: {}&quot;, a[index]);

        index += 1;
    }
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, the code counts up through the elements in the array. It starts at index 0, and then loops until it reaches the
final index in the array (that is, when <code>index &lt; 5</code> is no longer <code>true</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run

<p>All five array values appear in the terminal, as expected. Even though <code>index</code> will reach a value of 5 at some point,
the loop stops executing before trying to fetch a sixth value from the array.</p>
<p>However, this approach is error prone; we could cause the program to panic if the index value or test condition is
incorrect. For example, if you changed the definition of the <code>a</code> array to have four elements but forgot to update the
condition to <code>while index &lt; 4</code>, the code would panic. It's also slow, because the compiler adds runtime code to perform
the conditional check or whether the index is within the bounds of the array on every iteration through the loop.</p>
<p>As a more concise alternative, you can use a <code>for</code> loop and execute some code for each item in a collection.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!(&quot;the value is: {element}&quot;);
    }
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>When we run this code, we'll see the same output as previous example. More importantly, we've now increased the safety
of the code and eliminated the chance of bugs that might result from goint beyond the end of the array or not going far
enough and missing some items.</p>
<p>Using the <code>for</code> loop, you wouldn't need to remember to change any other code if you changed the number of values in the
array.</p>
<p>The safety and conciseness of <code>for</code> loops make them the most commonly used loop construct in Rust. Even in situations in
which you want to run some code a certain number of times, as in the countdown example that used a <code>while</code> loop, most
Rustaceans would use a <code>for</code> loop. The way to do that would be to use a <code>Range</code>, provided by the standard library, which
generates all numbers in sequence starting from one number and ending before another number.</p>
<p>Here's what the countdown would look like using a <code>for</code> loop and another method we've not yet talked about, <code>rev</code>, to
reverse the range:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!(&quot;{number}!&quot;);

}</code></pre></pre>

<p>When you're ready to move on, we'll talk about a concept in Rust that doesn't commonly exist in other programming
languages: ownership.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="understanding-ownership"><a class="header" href="#understanding-ownership">Understanding Ownership</a></h1>
<p>Ownership is Rust's most unique feature and has deep implication for the rest of the language. It enables Rust to make
memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector, so it's important to understand how ownership works. In
this chapter, we'll talk about ownership as well as several related features: borrowing, slices, and how Rust lays data
out in memory.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ownership"><a class="header" href="#what-is-ownership">What is Ownership?</a></h2>
<p>Ownership is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory. All programs have to manage the way they use
a computer's memory while running. Some languages have garbage collection that regularly looks for no-longer-used memory
as the program runs; in other languages, the programmer must explicitly allocate and free the memory. Rust uses a third
approach: memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks. If any of the
rules are violated, the program won't compile. None of the features of ownership will slow down your program while it's
running.</p>
<p>Because ownership is a new concept for many programmers, it does take some time to get used to. The good news is that
the more experienced you become with Rust and the rules of the ownership system, the easier you'll find it to naturally
deveop code that is safe and efficient. Keep at it!</p>
<p>When you understand ownership, you'll have a solid foundation for understanding the features that make Rust unique. In
this chapter, you'll learn ownership by working through some examples that focus on a very common data structures:
strings.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="the-stack-and-the-heap"><a class="header" href="#the-stack-and-the-heap">The Stack and the Heap</a></h4>
<p>Many programming languages doesn't require you to think about the stack and the heap very often. But in a systems
programming language like Rust, whether a value is on the stack or the heap affects how the language behaves and why
you
have to make certain decisions. Parts of ownership will be described in relation to the stack and the heap later in
this
chapter, so here is a brief explanation in preparation.</p>
<p>Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code to use at runtime, but they are structured in
different ways. The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order. This
is
referred to as last in, first out. Adding data is called pushing onto the stack, and removing data is called popping
off
the stack. All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown size at compile time or a
size that might change must be stored on the heap instead.</p>
<p>The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a certain amount of space. They memory
allocator
finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a pointer, which is the
address of that location. This process is called allocating on the heap and is sometimes abbreviated as just
allocating (pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating). Because the pointer to the heap is a known,
fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want the actual data, you must follow the pointer.</p>
<p>Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the allocator never has to search for a place to
store new data; that location is always at the top of the stack. Comparatively, allocating space on the heap requires
more work because the allocator must first find a big enough space to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to
prepare for the next allocation.</p>
<p>Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because you have to follow a pointer to get
there.
Contemporary processors are faster if they jump around less in memory. A processor can do its job better if it works
on
data that's close to other data (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the heap).</p>
<p>When your code calls a function, the values passed in to the function (including, potentially, pointers to data on the
heap) and the function's local variable get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those values get popped
off the stack.</p>
<p>Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap, minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the
heap, and cleaning up unused data on the heap so you don't run out of space are all problems that ownership addresses.
Once you understand ownership, you won't need to think about the stack and the heap very often, but knowing that the
main purpose of ownership is to manage heap data can help explain why it works the way it does.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ownership-rules"><a class="header" href="#ownership-rules">Ownership Rules</a></h3>
<p>First, let's take a look at the ownership rules. Keep these rules in mind as we work through the examples that
illustrate them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each value in Rust has an owner.</li>
<li>There can only be one owner at a time.</li>
<li>When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="variable-scope"><a class="header" href="#variable-scope">Variable Scope</a></h3>
<p>Now that we're past basic Rust syntax, we won't include all the <code>fn main() {</code> code in examples, so if you're following
along, make sure to put the following examples inside a <code>main</code> function manually. As a result, our examples will be a
bit more concise, letting us focus on the actual details rather than boilerplate code.</p>
<p>As a first example of ownership, we'll look at the scope of some variables. A scope is the range within a program for
which an item is valid.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s = &quot;hello&quot;;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>s</code> refers to a string literal, where the value of the string is hardcoded into the text of our program.
The variable is valid from the point at which it's declared until the end of the current scope.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    {                       // s is not valid here, since it's not yet declared
        let s = &quot;hello&quot;;    // s is valid from this point forward
        
        // do stuff with s
    }                       // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>In other words, there are two important points in time here:</p>
<ul>
<li>When <code>s</code> comes into scope, it is valid.</li>
<li>It remains valid until it goes out of scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, the relationship between scopes and when variables are valid is similar to that in other programming
languages. Now we'll build on top of this understanding by introducing the <code>String</code> type.</p>
<h3 id="the-string-type"><a class="header" href="#the-string-type">The String Type</a></h3>
<p>To illustrate the rules of ownership, we need a data type that is more complex than those we covered in &quot;Data Types&quot;.
The types covered previously are of a known size, can be stored on the stack and popped off the stack when their scope
is over, and can be quickly and trivially copied to make a new, independent instance if another part of code needs to
use the same value in a different scope. But we want to look at data that is stored on the heap and explore how Rust
knows when to clean up that data, and the <code>String</code> type is a great example.</p>
<p>We'll concentrate on the parts of <code>String</code> that relate to the ownership. These aspects also apply to other complex data
types, whether they are provided by the standard library or created by you. We'll discuss <code>String</code> in more depth in
Chapter 8.</p>
<p>We've already seen string literals, where a string value is hardcoded into our program. String literals are convenient,
but they aren't suitable for every situation in which we may want to use text. One reason is that they're immutable.
Another is that not every string value can be known when we write our code: for example, what if we want to take user
input and store it? For these situations, Rust has a second string type, <code>String</code>. This type manages data allocated on
the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that is unknown to us at compile time. You can create a <code>String</code>
from a string literal using the <code>from</code> function, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>The double colon <code>::</code> operator allows us to namespace this particular <code>from</code> function under the <code>String</code> type rather
than using some sort of name like <code>string_from</code>. We'll discuss this syntax more in &quot;Method Syntax&quot;, and when we talk
about namespacing with modules in &quot;Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree&quot;.</p>
<p>This kind of string can be mutated:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
    
    s.push_str(&quot;, world!&quot;);  // push_str() appends a literal to a String
    
    println!(&quot;{s}&quot;);  // this will print `hello, world!`
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>So, what's the difference here? Why can <code>String</code> be mutated but literals cannot? The difference is in how these two
types deal with memory.</p>
<h3 id="memory-and-allocation"><a class="header" href="#memory-and-allocation">Memory and Allocation</a></h3>
<p>In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time, so the text is hardcoded directly into the final
executable. This is why string literals are fast and efficient. But these properties only come from the string literal's
immutability. Unfortunately, we can't put a blob of memory into the binary for each piece of text whose size is unknown
at compile time and whose size might change while running the program.</p>
<p>With the <code>String</code> type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text, we need to allocate an amount of memory
on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold the contents. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.</li>
<li>We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we're done with our <code>String</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That first part is done by us: when we call <code>String::from</code>, its implementation request the memory it needs. This is
pretty much universal in programming languages.</p>
<p>However, the second part is different. In languages with a garbage collector(GC), the GC keeps track of and cleans up
memory that isn't being used anymore, and we don't need to think about it. In most languages without a GC, it's our
responsibility to identify when memory is no longer being used and to call code to explicitly free it, just as we did to
request it. Doing this correctly has historically been a difficult programming problem. If we forget, we'll waste
memory. If we do it too early, we'll have an invalid variable. If we do it twice, that's a bug too. We need to pair
exactly one <code>allocate</code> with exactly one <code>free</code>.</p>
<p>Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope.
Here's a version of our scope example using a <code>String</code> instead of a string literal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    {
        let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);  // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                                   // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>There is a natural point at which we can return the memory our <code>String</code> needs to the allocator: when <code>s</code> goes out of
scope. When a variable goes out of scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called <code>drop</code>, and it's
where the author of <code>String</code> can put the code to return the memory. Rust calls <code>drop</code> automatically at the closing curly
bracket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item's lifetime is sometimes called Resource
Acquisition is Initialization (RAII). The <code>drop</code> function in Rust will be familiar to you if you've used RAII
patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pattern has a profound impact on the way Rust code is written. It may seem simple right now, but the behavior of
code can be unexpected in more complicated situations when we want to have multiple variables use the data we've
allocated on the heap. Let's explore some of those situations now.</p>
<h4 id="variables-and-data-interacting-with-move"><a class="header" href="#variables-and-data-interacting-with-move">Variables and Data Interacting with Move</a></h4>
<p>Multiple variables can interact with the same data in different ways in Rust.</p>

</span>    let x = 5;
    let y = x;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>We can probably guess what this is doing: &quot;bind the value 5 to <code>x</code>; then make a copy of the value in <code>x</code> and bind it
to <code>y</code>.&quot; We now have two variables, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and both equal <code>5</code>. This is indeed what is happening, because integers
are simple values with a known, fixed size, and these two <code>5</code> values are pushed onto the stack.</p>
<p>Now let's look at the <code>String</code> version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
    let s2 = s1;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>This looks very similar, so we might assume that the way it works would be the same: that is, the second line would make
a copy of the value in <code>s1</code> and bind it to <code>s2</code>. But this isn't quite what happens.</p>
<p>Take a look at Figure to see what is happening to <code>String</code> under the covers. A <code>String</code> is made up of three parts, shown
on the left: a pointer to the memory that holds the contents of the string, a length, and a capacity. This group of data
is stored on the stack. On the right is the memory on the heap that holds the contents.</p>
<p><img src="./images/figure_4_1.png" alt="Figure 4-1" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Figure 4-1: Representation in memory of a <code>String</code> holding the value <code>&quot;hello&quot;</code> bound to <code>s1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the <code>String</code> are currently using. The capacity is the total
amount of memory, in bytes, that the <code>String</code> has received from the allocator. The difference between length and
capacity matters, but not in this context, so for now, it's fine to ignore the capacity.</p>
<p>When we assign <code>s1</code> to <code>s2</code>, the <code>String</code> data is copied, meaning we copy the pointer, the length, and the capacity that
are on the stack. We do not copy the data on the heap that the pointer refers to. In other words, the data
representation in memory looks like this.</p>
<p><img src="./images/figure_4_2.png" alt="Figure 4-2" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Figure 4-2: Representation in memory of the variable <code>s2</code> that has a copy of the pointer, length, and capacity of <code>s1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The representation does not look like Figure 4-3, which is what memory would look like if Rust instead copied the heap
data as well. If Rust did this, the operation <code>s2 = s1</code> could be very expensive in terms of runtime performance if the
data on the heap were large.</p>
<p><img src="./images/figure_4_3.png" alt="Figure 4-3" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Figure 4-3: Another possibility for what <code>s2 = s1</code> might do if Rust copied the heap data as well</li>
</ul>
<p>Earlier, we said that when a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically calls the <code>drop</code> function that cleans up the
heap memory for that variable. But Figure 4-2 shows both data pointers pointing to the same location. This is a problem:
when <code>s2</code> and <code>s1</code> go out of scope they will both try to free the same memory. This is known as a double free error and
is one of the memory safety bugs we mentioned previously. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory corruption, which can
potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>To ensure memory safety, after the line <code>let s2 = s1;</code>, Rust considers <code>s1</code> as no longer valid. Therefore, Rust doesn't
need to free anything when <code>s1</code> goes out of scope. Check out what happens when you try to use <code>s1</code> after <code>s2</code> is
created; it won't work:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
    let s2 = s1;
    
    println!(&quot;{s1}, world!&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>You'll get an error like this because Rust prevents you from using the invalidated reference:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `s1`
 --&gt; src\main.rs:5:16
  |
2 |     let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
  |         -- move occurs because `s1` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
3 |     let s2 = s1;
  |              -- value moved here
4 |
5 |     println!(&quot;{s1}, world!&quot;);
  |                ^^ value borrowed here after move
  |
</code></pre>
<p>If you've heard the terms shallow copy and deep copy while working with other languages, the concept of copying the
pointer, length, and capacity without copying the data probably sounds like making a shallow copy. But because Rust also
invalidates the first variable, instead of being called a shallow copy, it's known as a move. In this example, we would
say that <code>s1</code> was moved into <code>s2</code>. So, what actually happens is shown in Figure 4-4.</p>
<p><img src="./images/figure_4_4.png" alt="Figure 4-4" /></p>
<p>That solves our problem! With only <code>s2</code> valid, when it goes out of scope it alone will free the memory, and we're done.</p>
<p>In addition, there's a design choice that's implied by this: Rust will never automatically create &quot;deep&quot; copies of your
data. Therefore, any automatic copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance.</p>
<h4 id="variables-and-data-interacting-with-clone"><a class="header" href="#variables-and-data-interacting-with-clone">Variables and Data Interacting with Clone</a></h4>
<p>If we do want to deeply copy the heap data of the <code>String</code>, not just the stack data, we can use a common method
called <code>clone</code>. We'll discuss method syntax in Chapter 5, but because methods are a common feature in many programming
languages, you've probably seen them before.</p>
<p>Here's an example of the <code>clone</code> method in action:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
    let s2 = s1.clone();

    println!(&quot;s1 = {s1}, s2 = {s2}&quot;);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This works just the fine and explicitly produces the behavior shown in Figure 4-3, where the heap data does get copied.</p>
<p>When you see a call to <code>clone</code>, you know that some arbitrary code is being executed and that code may be expensive. It's
a visual indicator that something different is going on.</p>
<h4 id="stack-only-data-copy"><a class="header" href="#stack-only-data-copy">Stack-Only Data: Copy</a></h4>
<p>There's another wrinkle we haven't talked about yet. This code using integers works and is valid:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let x = 5;
    let y = x;
    
    println!(&quot;x = {x}, y = {y}&quot;);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>But this code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don't have a call to <code>clone</code>, but <code>x</code> is still valid and
wasn't moved into <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile time are stored entirely on the stack, so
copies of the actual values are quick to make. That means there's no reason we would want to prevent <code>x</code> from being
valid after we create the variable <code>y</code>. In other words, there's no difference between deep and shallow copying here, so
calling <code>clone</code> wouldn't do anything different from the usual shallow copying, and we can leave it out.</p>
<p>Rust has a special annotation called the <code>Copy</code> trait that we can place on types that are stored on the stack, as
integers are (we'll talk more about traits in Chapter 10). If a type implements the <code>Copy</code> trait, variables that use it
do not move, but rather are trivially copied, making them still valid after assignment to another variable.</p>
<p>Rust won't let us annotate a type with <code>Copy</code> if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the <code>Drop</code> trait. If the
type needs something special to happen when the value goes out of scope and we add the <code>Copy</code> annotation to that type,
we'll get a compile-time error. To learn about how to add the <code>Copy</code> annotation to your type to implement the trait, see
Appendix C.</p>
<p>So, what types implement the <code>Copy</code> trait? You can check the documentation for the given type to be sure, but as a
general rule, any group of simple scalar values can implement <code>Copy</code>, and nothing that requires allocation or is some
form of resource can implement <code>Copy</code>. Here are some of the types that implement <code>Copy</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the integer types, such as <code>u32</code>.</li>
<li>The Boolean type, <code>bool</code>, with values <code>true</code> and `false.</li>
<li>All the floating-point types, such as <code>f64</code>.</li>
<li>The character type, <code>char</code>.</li>
<li>Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement <code>Copy</code>. For example, (<code>i32</code>, <code>i32</code>) implements <code>Copy</code>,
but (<code>i32</code>, <code>String</code>) does not.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ownership-and-functions"><a class="header" href="#ownership-and-functions">Ownership and Functions</a></h3>
<p>The mechanics of passing a value to a function are similar to those when assigning a value to a variable. Passing a
variable to a function will move or copy, just as assignment does. Here's an example with some annotations showing where
variables go into and out of scope.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but `i32` is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward
                                    
}  // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. However, because s's value was moved,
   // nothing special happens. 

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) {  // some_string comes into scope
    println!(&quot;{some_string}&quot;);
}  // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
   // memory is free.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) {  // some_integer comes into scope
    println!(&quot;{some_integer}&quot;);
}  // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.</code></pre></pre>
<p>If we tried to use <code>s</code> after the call to <code>takes_ownership</code>, Rust would throw a compile-time error. These static checks
protect us from mistakes. Try adding code to <code>main</code> that uses <code>s</code> and <code>x</code> to see where you can use them and where the
ownership rules prevent you from doing so.</p>
<h3 id="return-values-and-scope"><a class="header" href="#return-values-and-scope">Return Values and Scope</a></h3>
<p>Returning values can also transfer ownership. Shows an example of a function that returns some value, with similar
annotations as those in last example.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1
                                        
    let s2 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);     // s2 comes into scope
    
    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
}  // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
   // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -&gt; String {                // gives_ownership will move its
                                                // return value into the function
                                                // that calls it
                                                
    let some_string = String::from(&quot;yours&quot;);    // some_string comes into scope
    
    some_string                                 // some_string is returned and
                                                // moves out to the calling
                                                // function
}

// This function takes a String and returns a String.
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -&gt; String {   // a_string comes into scope

    a_string    // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time: assigning a value to another variable moves it. When a
variable that includes data on the heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by <code>drop</code> unless ownership of
the data has been moved to another variable.</p>
<p>While this works, taking ownership and then returning ownership with every function is a bit tedious. What if we want to
let a function use a value but not take ownership? It's quite annoying that anything we pass in also needs to be passed
back if we want to use it again, in addition to any data resulting from the body of the function that we might want to
return as well.</p>
<p>Rust does let us return multiple values using a tuple:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

    println!(&quot;The length of '{s2}' is {len}.&quot;);
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -&gt; (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len();  // len() returns the length of a String

    (s, length)
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Listing 4-5: Returning ownership of parameters</p>
<p>But this is too much ceremony and a lot of work for a concept that should be common. Luckily for us, Rust has a feature
for using a value without transferring ownership, called references.</p>
<h2 id="references-and-borrowing"><a class="header" href="#references-and-borrowing">References and Borrowing</a></h2>
<p>The issue with the tuple code in Listing 4-5 is that we have to return the <code>String</code> to the calling function so we can
still use the <code>String</code> after the call to <code>calculate_length</code>, because the <code>String</code> was moved into <code>calculate_length</code>.
Instead, we can provide a reference to the <code>String</code> value. A reference is like a pointer in that it's an address we can
follow to access the data stored at that address; that data is owned by some other variable. Unlike a pointer, a
reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type for the life of that reference.</p>
<p>Here is how you would define and use a <code>calculate_length</code> function that has a reference to an object as a parameter
instead of taking ownership of the value:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    let len = calculate_length(&amp;s1);

    println!(&quot;The length of '{s1}' is {len}.&quot;);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize {
    s.len()
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>First, notice that all the tuple code in the variable declaration and the function return value is gone. Second, note
that we pass <code>&amp;s1</code> into <code>calculate_length</code> and, in its definition, we take <code>&amp;String</code> rather than <code>String</code>. These
ampersands represent references, and they allow you to refer to some value without taking ownership of it. Figure 4-5
depicts this concept.</p>
<p><img src="./images/figure_4_5.png" alt="Figure 4-5" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Figure 4-5: A diagram of <code>&amp;String s</code> pointing at <code>String s1</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The opposite of referencing by using <code>&amp;</code> is dereferencing, which is accomplished with the dereference operator, <code>*</code>.
We'll see some uses of the dereference operator in Chapter 8 and discuss details of dereferencing in Chapter 15.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's take a closer look at the function call here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
    
    let len = calculate_length(&amp;s1);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>&amp;s1</code> syntax lets us create a reference that refers to the value of <code>s1</code> but does not own it. Because it does not
own it, the value it points to will not be dropped when the reference stops being used.</p>
<p>Likewise, the signature of the function uses <code>&amp;</code> to indicate that the type of the parameter <code>s</code> is a reference. Let's
add some explanatory annotations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn calculate_length(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize {  // s is a reference to a String
    s.len()
}  // Here, s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of what
   // it refers to, the String is not dropped.</code></pre>
<p>The scope in which the variable <code>s</code> is valid is the same as any function parameter's scope, but the value pointed to by
the reference is not dropped when <code>s</code> stops being used, because <code>s</code> doesn't have ownership. When functions have
references as parameters instead of the actual values, we won't need to return the values in order to give back
ownership, because we never had ownership.</p>
<p>We call the action of creating a reference borrowing. As in real life, if a person owns something, you can borrow it
from them. When you're done, you have to give it back. You don't own it.</p>
<p>So, what happens if we try to modify something we're borrowing? Try the code in Listing 4-6. Spoiler alert: it doesn't
work!</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    change(&amp;s);
}

fn change(some_string: &amp;String) {
    some_string.push_str(&quot;, world&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 4-6: Attempting to modify a borrowed value</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the error:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references. We're not allowed to modify something we have a reference
to.</p>
<h3 id="mutable-references"><a class="header" href="#mutable-references">Mutable References</a></h3>
<p>We can fix the code from Listing 4-6 to allow us to modify a borrowed value with just a few small tweaks that use,
instead, a mutable reference:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    change(&amp;mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &amp;mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(&quot;, world&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>First we change <code>s</code> to be <code>mut</code>. Then we create a mutable reference with <code>&amp;mut s</code> where we call the <code>change</code> function,
and update the function signature to accept a mutable reference with <code>some_string: &amp;mut String</code>. This makes it very
clear that the <code>change</code> function will mutate the value it borrows.</p>
<p>Mutable references have one big restriction: if you have a mutable reference to a value, you can have no other
references to that value. This code that attempts to create two mutable references to <code>s</code> will fail:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    let r1 = &amp;mut s;
    let r2 = &amp;mut s;

</code></pre>
<p>This error says that this code is invalid because we cannot borrow <code>s</code> as mutable more than once at a time. The first
mutable borrow is in <code>r1</code> and must last until it's used in the <code>println!</code>, but between the creation of that mutable
reference and its usage, we tried to create another mutable reference in <code>r2</code> that borrows the same data as <code>r1</code>.</p>
<p>The restriction preventing multiple mutable references to the same data at the same time allows for mutation but in a
very controlled fashion. It's something that new Rustaceans struggle with because most languages let you mutate whenever
you'd like. The benefit of having this restriction is that Rust can prevent data races at compile time. A data race is
similar to a race condition and happens when these three behaviors occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.</li>
<li>At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.</li>
<li>There's no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data races cause undefined behavior and can be difficult to diagnose and fix when you're trying to track them down at
runtime; Rust prevents this problem by refusing to compile code with data races!</p>
<p>As always, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for multiple mutable references, just not
simultaneous ones:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    {
        let r1 = &amp;mut s;
    }  // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems
    
    let r2 = &amp;mut s;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>Rust enforces a similar rule for combining mutable and immutable references. This code results in an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {

</code></pre>
<p>Whew! We also cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one to the same value.</p>
<p>Users of an immutable reference don't expect the value to suddenly change out from under them! However, multiple
immutable references are allowed because no one who is just reading the data has the ability to affect anyone else's
reading of the data.</p>
<p>Note that a reference's scope starts from where it is introduced and continues through the last time that reference is
used. For instance, this code will compile because the last usage of the immutable references, the <code>println!</code>, occurs
before the mutable reference is introduced:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    println!(&quot;{r1} and {r2}&quot;);
    // Variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point.

    let r3 = &amp;mut s; // no problem
    println!(&quot;{r3}&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The scopes of the immutable references <code>r1</code> and <code>r2</code> end after the <code>println!</code> where they are last used, which is before
the mutable reference <code>r3</code> is created. These scopes don't overlap, so this code is allowed: the compiler can tell that
the reference is no longer being used at a point before the end of the scope.</p>
<p>Even though borrowing errors may be frustrating at times, remember that it's the Rust compiler pointing out a potential
bug early (at compile time rather than at runtime) and showing you exactly where the problem is. Then you don't have to
track down why your data isn't what you thought it was.</p>
<h3 id="dangling-references"><a class="header" href="#dangling-references">Dangling References</a></h3>
<p>In languages with pointers, it's easy to erroneously create a dangling pointer - a pointer that references a location in
memory that may have been given to someone else - by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory. In
Rust, by contrast, the compiler guarantees that references will never be dangling references: if you have a reference to
some data, the compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the reference to the data does.</p>
<p>Let's try to create a dangling reference to see how Rust prevents them with a compile-time error:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -&gt; &amp;String {
    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    &amp;s
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Here's the error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier

<p>This error message refers to a feature we haven't covered yet: lifetimes. We'll discuss lifetimes in detail in Chapter</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>But, if you disregard the parts about lifetimes, the message does contain the key to why this code is a problem:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-text">this function's return type contains a borrowed value,

</code></pre>
<p>Let's take a closer look at exactly what's happening at each stage of our dangle code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();

    &amp;s  // we return a reference to the String, s
}  // Here, s goes out of scope and is dropped, so its memory goes away.
   // Danger!</code></pre>
<p>Because <code>s</code> is created inside <code>dangle</code>, when the code of <code>dangle</code> is finished, <code>s</code> will be deallocated. But we tried to
return a reference to it. That means this reference would be pointing to an invalid <code>String</code>. That's no good! Rust won't
let us do this.</p>
<p>The solution here is to return the <code>String</code> directly:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021"><span class="boring">fn main() {

<p>This works without any problems. Ownership is moved out, and nothing is deallocated.</p>
<h3 id="the-rules-of-references"><a class="header" href="#the-rules-of-references">The Rules of References</a></h3>
<p>Let's recap what we've discussed about references:</p>
<ul>
<li>At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.</li>
<li>References must always be valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we'll look at a different kind of reference: slices.</p>
<h2 id="the-slice-type"><a class="header" href="#the-slice-type">The Slice Type</a></h2>
<p>Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection. A slice is
a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership.</p>
<p>Here's a small programming problem: write a function that takes a string of words separated by spaces and returns the
first word it finds in that string. If the function doesn't find a space in the string, the whole string must be one
word, so the entire string should be returned.</p>
<p>Let's work through how we'd write the signature of this function without using slices, to understand the problem that
slices will solve:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; ?</code></pre>
<p>The <code>first_word</code> function has a parameter of type <code>&amp;String</code>. We don't want ownership, so this is fine. But what should
we return? We don't really have a way to talk about part of a string. However, we could return the index of the end of
the word, indicated by a space. Let's try that, as shown in Listing 4-7.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let string = String::from(&quot;hello, world!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let first_word = first_word(&amp;string);
</span><span class="boring">    
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;{first_word}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span>fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize {                // 1
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &amp;item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {    // 2, 3
        if item == b' ' {                           // 4
            return i;
        }
    }

    s.len()     // 5
}</code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 4-7: The <code>first_word</code> function that returns a byte index value into the <code>String</code> parameter</li>
</ul>
<p>Because we need to go through the <code>String</code> element by element and check whether a value is a space, we'll convert
our <code>String</code> to an array of bytes using the <code>as_bytes</code> method (1).</p>
<p>Next, we create an iterator over the array of bytes using the <code>iter</code> method (3). We'll discuss iterators in more detail
in Chapter 13. For now, know that <code>iter</code> is a method that returns each element in a collection and that <code>enumerate</code>
wraps the result of <code>iter</code> and returns each element as part of a tuple instead. The first element of the tuple returned
from <code>enumerate</code> is the index, and the second element is a reference to the element. This is a bit more convenient than
calculating the index ourselves.</p>
<p>Because the <code>enumerate</code> method returns a tuple, we can use patterns to destructure that tuple. We'll be discussing
patterns more in Chapter 6. In the <code>for</code> loop, we specify a pattern that has <code>i</code> for the index in the tuple and <code>&amp;item</code>
for the single byte in the tuple (2). Because we get a reference to the element from <code>.iter().enumerate()</code>, we use <code>&amp;</code>
in the pattern.</p>
<p>Inside the <code>for</code> loop, we search for the byte that represents the space by using the byte literal syntax (4). If we find
a space, we return the position. Otherwise, we return the length of the string by using <code>s.len()</code> (5).</p>
<p>We now have a way to find out the index of the end of the first word in the string, but there's a problem. We're
returning a <code>usize</code> on its own, but it's only a meaningful number in the context of the <code>&amp;String</code>. In other words,
because it's a separate value from the <code>String</code>, there's no guarantee that it will still be valid in the future.
Consider the program in Listing 4-8 that uses the <code>first_word</code> function from Listing 4-7.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello world&quot;);

    let word = first_word(&amp;s);  // word will get the value 5

    s.clear();  // this empties the String, making it equal to &quot;&quot;

    // word still has the value 5 here, but there's no more string that
    // we could meaningfully use the value 5 with. word is not totally invalid!
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 4-8: Storing the result from calling the <code>first_word</code> function and then changing the <code>String</code> contents</li>
</ul>
<p>This program compiles without any errors and would also do so if we used <code>word</code> after calling <code>s.clear()</code>.
Because <code>word</code> isn't connected to the state of <code>s</code> at all, <code>word</code> still contains the value <code>5</code>. We could use that
value <code>5</code> with the variable <code>s</code> to try to extract the first word out, but this would be a bug because the contents
of <code>s</code> have changed since we saved <code>5</code> in <code>word</code>.</p>
<p>Having to worry about the index in <code>word</code> getting out of sync with the data in <code>s</code> is tedious and error prone! Managing
these indices is even more brittle if we write a <code>second_word</code> function. Its signature would have to look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn second_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; (usize, usize) {</code></pre>
<p>Now we're tracking a starting and an ending index, and we have even more values that were calculated from data in a
particular state but aren't tied to that state at all. We have three unrelated variables floating around that need to be
kept in sync.</p>
<p>Luckily, Rust has a solution to this problem: string slices.</p>
<h3 id="string-slices"><a class="header" href="#string-slices">String Slices</a></h3>
<p>A string slice is a reference to part of a <code>String</code>, and it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s = String::from(&quot;hello world&quot;);
    
    let hello = &amp;s[0..5];
    let world = &amp;s[6..11];
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>Rather than a reference to the entire <code>String</code>, <code>hello</code> is a reference to a portion of the <code>String</code>, specified in the
extra <code>[0..5]</code> bit. We create slices using a range within brackets by specifying <code>[starting_index..ending_index]</code>,
where <code>starting_index</code> is the first position in the slice and <code>ending_index</code> is one more than the last position in the
slice. Internally, the slice data structure stores the starting position and the length of the slice, which ccorresponds
to <code>ending_index</code> minus <code>starting_index</code>. So, in the case of <code>let world = &amp;s[6..11];</code> <code>world</code> would be a slice that
contains a pointer to the byte at index 6 of <code>s</code> with a length value of <code>5</code>.</p>
<p><img src="./images/figure_4_6.png" alt="Figure 4-6" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Figure 4-6: String slice referring to part of a <code>String</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With Rust's <code>..</code> range syntax, if you want to start at index 0, you can drop the value before the two periods. In other
words, these are equal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
    
    let slice = &amp;s[0..2];
    let slice = &amp;s[..2];
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>By the same token, if your slice includes the last byte of the <code>String</code>, you can drop the trailing number. That means
these are equal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
    
    let len = s.len();
    
    let slice = &amp;s[3..len];
    let slice = &amp;s[3..];
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>You can also drop both values to take a slice of the entire string. So these are equal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    let len = s.len();

    let slice = &amp;s[0..len];
    let slice = &amp;s[..];
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>String slice range indices must occur at value UTF-8 character boundaries. If you attempt to create a string slice in
the middle of a multibyte character, your program will exit with an error. For the purposes of introducing string
slices, we are assuming ASCII only in this section; a more through discussion of UTF-8 handling is in &quot;Storing UTF-8
Encoded Text with Strings&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With all this information in mind, let's rewrite <code>first_word</code> to return a slice. The type that signifies &quot;string slice&quot;
is written as <code>&amp;str</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; &amp;str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &amp;item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &amp;s[o..i];
        }
    }
    
    &amp;s[..]
}</code></pre>
<p>We get the index for the end of the word the same way we did in Listing 4-7, by looking for the first occurrence of a
space. When we find a space, we return a string slice using the start of the string and the index of the space as the
starting and ending indices.</p>
<p>Now when we call <code>first_word</code>, we get back a single value that is tied to the underlying data. The value is made up of a
reference to the starting point of the slice and the number of elements in the slice.</p>
<p>Returning a slice would also work for a <code>second_word</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn second_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; &amp;str {</code></pre>
<p>We now have a straightforward API that's much harder to mess up because the compiler will ensure the references into
the <code>String</code> remain valid. Remember the bug in the program in Listing 4-8, when we got the index to the end of the first
word but then cleared the string so our index was invalid? That code was logically incorrect but didn't show any
immediate errors. The problems would show up later if we kept trying to use the first word index with an emptied string.
Slices make this bug impossible and let us know we have a problem with our code much sooner. Using the slice version
of <code>first_word</code> will throw a compile-time error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; &amp;str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    for (i, &amp;item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &amp;s[0..i];
        }
    }
    &amp;s[..]
}

fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello world&quot;);

    let word = first_word(&amp;s);

    s.clear();  // error!

    println!(&quot;the first word is: {word}&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<p>Here's the compiler error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
  --&gt; src\main.rs:17:5

17 |     s.clear();  // error!

   |                                   ---- immutable borrow later used here
</code></pre>
<p>Recall from the borrowing rules that if we have an immutable reference to something, we cannot also take a mutable
reference. Because <code>clear</code> needs to truncate the <code>String</code>, it needs to get a mutable reference. The <code>println!</code> after the
call to <code>clear</code> uses the reference in <code>word</code>, so the immutable reference must still be active at that point. Rust
disallows the mutable reference in <code>clear</code> and the immutable reference in <code>word</code> from existing at the same time, and
compilation fails. Not only has Rust made our API easier to use, but it has also eliminated an entire class of errors at
compile time!</p>
<h4 id="string-literals-as-slices"><a class="header" href="#string-literals-as-slices">String Literals as Slices</a></h4>
<p>Recall that we talked about string literals being stored inside the binary. Now that we know about slices, we can
properly understand string literals:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let s = &quot;Hello, world!&quot;;</code></pre>
<p>The type of <code>s</code> here is <code>&amp;str</code>: it's a slice pointing to that specific point of the binary. This is also why string
literals are immutable; <code>&amp;str</code> is an immutable reference.</p>
<h4 id="string-slices-as-parameters"><a class="header" href="#string-slices-as-parameters">String Slices as Parameters</a></h4>
<p>Knowing that you can take slices of literals and <code>String</code> values leads us to one more improvement on <code>first_word</code>, and
that's its signature:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; &amp;str {</code></pre>
<p>A more experienced Rustacean would write the signature shown in Listing 4-9 instead because it allows us to use the same
function on both <code>&amp;String</code> values and <code>&amp;str</code> values.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn first_word(s: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 4-9: Improving the <code>first_word</code> function by using a string slice for the type of the <code>s</code> parameter</li>
</ul>
<p>If we have a string slice, we can pass that directly. If we have a <code>String</code>, we can pass a slice of the <code>String</code> or a
reference to the <code>String</code>. This flexibility takes advantage of deref coercions, a feature we will cover in &quot;Implicit
Deref Coercions with Functions and Methods&quot;.</p>
<p>Defining a function to take a string slice instead of a reference to a <code>String</code> makes our API more general and useful
without losing any functionality:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn first_word(s: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {

    let word = first_word(&amp;my_string[..]);

    let word = first_word(my_string_literal);
}</code></pre></pre>
<h3 id="other-slices"><a class="header" href="#other-slices">Other Slices</a></h3>
<p>String slices, as you might imagine, are specific to strings. But there's a more general slice type too. Consider this
array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];</code></pre>
<p>Just as we might want to refer to part of a string, we might want to refer to part of an array. We'd do so like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let slice = &amp;a[1..3];

    assert_eq!(slice, &amp;[2, 3]);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This slice has the type <code>&amp;[i32]</code>. It works the same way as string slices do, by storing a reference to the first element
and a length. You'll use this kind of slice for all sorts of other collections. We'll discuss these collections in
detail when we talk about vectors in Chapter 8.</p>
<h2 id="summary-3"><a class="header" href="#summary-3">Summary</a></h2>
<p>The concepts of ownership, borrowing, and slices ensure memory safety in Rust programs at compile time. The Rust
language gives you control over your memory usage in the same way as other systems' programming languages, but having
the owner of data automatically clean up that data when the owner goes out of scope means you don't have to write and
debug extra code to get this control.</p>
<p>Ownership affects how lots of other parts of Rust work, so we'll talk about these concepts further throughout the rest
of the book. Let's move on to Chapter 5 and look at grouping pieces of data together in a <code>struct</code>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="using-structs-to-structure-related-data"><a class="header" href="#using-structs-to-structure-related-data">Using Structs to Structure Related Data</a></h1>
<p>A <code>struct</code>, or structure, is a custom data type that lets you package together and name multiple related values that
make up a meaningful group. If you're familiar with an object-oriented language, a <code>struct</code> is like an object's data
attributes. In this chapter, we'll compare and contrast tuples with structs to build on what you already know and
demonstrate when struts are a better way to group data.</p>
<p>We'll demonstrate how to define and instantiate structs. We'll discuss how to define associated functions, especially
the kind of associated functions called methods, to specify behavior associated with a struct type. Structs and enums (
discussed in Chapter 6) are the building blocks for creating new types in your program's domain to take full advantage
of Rust's compile-time type checking.</p>
<h2 id="defining-and-instantiating-structs"><a class="header" href="#defining-and-instantiating-structs">Defining and Instantiating Structs</a></h2>
<p>Structs are similar to tuples, discussed in &quot;The Tuple Type&quot;, in that both hold multiple related values. Like tuples,
the pieces of a struct can be different types. Unlike with tuples, in a struct you'll name each piece of data so it's
clear what the value mean. Adding these names means that structs are more flexible than tuples: you don't have to rely
on the order of the data to specify or access the values of an instance.</p>
<p>To define a struct, we enter the keyword <code>struct</code> and name the entire struct. A struct's name should describe the
significance of the pieces of data being grouped together. Then, inside curly brackets, we define the names and types of
the pieces of data, which we call fields. For example, Listing 5-1 shows a struct that stores information about a user
account.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {}</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 5-1: A User struct definition</li>
</ul>
<p>To use a struct after we've defined it, we create an instance of that struct by specifying concrete values for each of
the fields. We create an instance by stating the name of the struct and then add curly brackets containing <code>key: value</code>
pairs, where the keys are the names of the fields and the values are the data we want to store in those fields. We don't
have to specify the fields in the same order in which we declared them in the struct. In other words, the struct
definition is like a general template for the type, and instances fill in that template with particular data to create
values of the type. For example, we can declare a particular user as shown in Listing 5-2.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: String::from(&quot;someusername123&quot;),
        email: String::from(&quot;someone@example.com&quot;),
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>To get a specific value from a struct, we use dot notation. For example, to access this user's email address, we
use <code>user1.email</code>. If the instance is mutable, we can change a value by using the dot notation and assigning into a
particular field. Listing 5-3 shows how to change the value in the <code>email</code> field of a mutable <code>User</code> instance.</p>

<p>Note that the entire instance must be mutable; Rust doesn't allow us to mark only certain fields as mutable. As with any

return that new instance.</p>

<li>Listing 5-4: A <code>build_user</code> function that takes an email and username and returns a <code>User</code> instance</li>
</ul>
<p>It makes sense to name the function parameters with the same name as the struct fields, but having to repeat the <code>email</code>
and <code>username</code> field names and variables is a bit tedious. If the struct had more fields, repeating each name would get
even more annoying. Luckily, there's a convenient shorthand!</p>
<h3 id="using-the-field-init-shorthand"><a class="header" href="#using-the-field-init-shorthand">Using the Field Init Shorthand</a></h3>
<p>Because the parameter names and the struct field names are exactly the same in Listing 5-4, we can use the field init
shorthand syntax to rewrite <code>build_user</code> so it behaves exactly the same but doesn't have the repetition of <code>username</code>
and <code>email</code>, as shown in Listing 5-5.</p>

<p>Here, we're creating a new instance of the <code>User</code> struct, which has a field named <code>email</code>. We want to set the <code>email</code>

<ul>
<li>Listing 5-7: Using struct update syntax to set a new <code>email</code> value for a <code>User</code> instance but to use the rest of the
values from <code>user1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The code in Listing 5-7 also creates an instance in <code>user2</code> that has a different value for <code>email</code> but has the same
values for the <code>username</code>, <code>active</code>, and <code>sign_in_count</code> fields from <code>user1</code>. The <code>..user1</code> must come last to specify
that any remaining fields should get their values from the corresponding fields in <code>user1</code>, but we can choose to specify
values for as many fields as we want in any order, regardless of the order of the fields in the struct's definition.</p>
<p>Note that the struct update syntax uses <code>=</code> like an assignment; this is because it moves the data, just as we saw in &quot;
Variables and Data Interacting with Move&quot;. In this example, we can no longer use <code>user1</code> after creating <code>user2</code> because
the <code>String</code> in the <code>username</code> field of <code>user1</code> was moved into <code>user2</code>. If we had given <code>user2</code> new <code>String</code> values for
both <code>email</code> and <code>username</code>, and thus only used the <code>active</code> and <code>sign_in_count</code> values from <code>user1</code>, then <code>user1</code> would
still be valid after creating <code>user2</code>. Both <code>active</code> and <code>sign_in_count</code> are types that implement the <code>Copy</code> trait, so
the behavior we discussed in &quot;Stack-Only Data: Copy&quot; would apply.</p>
<h3 id="using-tuple-structs-without-named-fields-to-create-different-types"><a class="header" href="#using-tuple-structs-without-named-fields-to-create-different-types">Using Tuple Structs Without Named Fields to Create Different Types</a></h3>
<p>Rust also supports structs that look similar to tuples, called tuple structs. Tuple structs have the added meaning the
struct name provides but don't have names associated with their fields; rather, they just have the types of the fields.
Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name and make the tuple a different type from other
tuples, and when naming each field as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant.</p>
<p>To define a tuple struct, start with the <code>struct</code> keyword and the struct name followed by the types in the tuple. For
example, here we define and use two tuple structs named <code>Color</code> and <code>Point</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>black</code> and <code>origin</code> values are different types because they're instances of different tuple structs. Each
struct you define is its own type, even though the fields within the struct might have the same types. For example, a
function that takes a parameter of type <code>Color</code> cannot take a <code>Point</code> as an argument, even though both types are made up
of three <code>i32</code> values. Otherwise, tuple struct instances are similar to tuples in that you can destructure them into
their individual pieces, and you can use a <code>.</code> followed by the index to access an individual value.</p>
<h3 id="unit-like-structs-without-any-fields"><a class="header" href="#unit-like-structs-without-any-fields">Unit-Like Structs Without Any Fields</a></h3>
<p>You can also define structs that don't have any fields! These are called unit-like structs because they behave similarly
to <code>()</code>, the unit type that we mentioned the &quot;The Tuple Type&quot;. Unit-like structs can be useful when you need to
implement a trait on some type but don't have any data that you want to store in the type itself. We'll discuss traits
in Chapter 10. Here's an example of declaring and instantiating a unit struct named <code>AlwaysEqual</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">struct AlwaysEqual;

fn main() {
    let subject = AlwaysEqual;
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>To define <code>AlwaysEqual</code>, we use the <code>struct</code> keyword, the name we want, and then a semicolon. No need for curly brackets
or parentheses! Then we can get an instance of <code>AlwaysEqual</code> in the <code>subject</code> variable in a similar way: using the name
we defined, without any curly brackets or parentheses. Imagine that later we'll implement behavior for this type such
that every instance of <code>AlwaysEqual</code> is always equal to every instance of any other type, perhaps to have a known result
for testing purposes. We wouldn't need any data to implement that behavior! You'll see in Chapter 10 how to define
traits and implement them on any type, including unit-like structs.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="ownership-of-struct-data"><a class="header" href="#ownership-of-struct-data">Ownership of Struct Data</a></h4>
<p>In the <code>User</code> struct definition in Listing 5-1, we used the owned <code>String</code> type rather than the <code>&amp;str</code> string slice
type. This is a deliberate choice because we want each instance of this struct to own all of its data and for that data
to be valid for as long as the entire struct is valid.</p>
<p>It's also possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else, but to do so requires the use of
lifetimes, a Rust feature that we'll discuss in Chapter 10. Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct is
valid for as long as the struct is. Let's say you try to store a reference in a struct without specifying lifetimes,
like the following in <code>src/main.rs</code>; this won't work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: &amp;str,
    email: &amp;str,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: &quot;someusername123&quot;,
        email: &quot;someone@example.com&quot;,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}</code></pre>
<p>The compiler will complain that it needs lifetime specifiers:</p>

<h2 id="an-example-program-using-structs"><a class="header" href="#an-example-program-using-structs">An Example Program Using Structs</a></h2>
<p>To understand when we might want to use structs, let's write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. We'll
start by using single variables, and then refactor the program until we're using structs instead.</p>
<p>Let's make a new binary project with Cargo called <code>rectangles</code> that will take the width and height of a rectangle
specified in pixels and calculate the area of the rectangle. Listing 5-8 shows a short program with one way of doing
exactly that in our project's <code>src/main.rs</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let width1 = 30;
    let height1 = 50;

    println!(
        &quot;The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.&quot;,
        area(width1, height1)
    );
}

fn area(width: u32, height: u32) -&gt; u32 {
    width * height
}</code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 5-8: Calculating the area of a rectangle specified by separate width and height variables</li>
</ul>
<p>This code succeeds in figuring out the area of the rectangle by calling the <code>area</code> function with each dimension, but we
can do more to make this code clear and readable.</p>
<p>The issue with this code is evident in the signature of <code>area</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn area(width: u32, height: u32) -&gt; u32 {</code></pre>
<p>The <code>area</code> function is supposed to calculate the area of one rectangle, but the function we wrote has two parameters,
and it's not clear anywhere in our program that the parameters are related. It would be more readable and more
manageable to group width and height together. We've already discussed one way we might do that in &quot;The Tuple Type&quot;: by
using tuples.</p>
<h3 id="refactoring-with-tuples"><a class="header" href="#refactoring-with-tuples">Refactoring with Tuples</a></h3>
<p>Listing 5-9 shows another version of our program that uses tuples.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let rect1 = (30, 50);

    println!(
        &quot;The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.&quot;,
        area(rect1)                         // 1
    );
}

fn area(dimensions: (u32, u32)) -&gt; u32 {
    dimensions.0 * dimensions.1             // 2
}</code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 5-9: Specifying the width and height of the rectangle with a tuple</li>
</ul>
<p>In one way, this program is better. Tuples let us add a bit of structure, and we're now passing just one argument (1).
But in another way, this version is less clear: tuples don't name their elements, so we have to index into the parts of
the tuple (2), making our calculation less obvious.</p>
<p>Mixing up the width and height wouldn't matter for the area calculation, but if we want to draw the rectangle on the
screen, it would matter! We would have to keep in mind that <code>width</code> is the tuple index <code>0</code> and <code>height</code> is the tuple
index <code>1</code>. This would be even harder for someone else to figure out and keep in mind if they were to use our code.
Because we haven't conveyed the meaning of our data in our code, it's now easier to introduce errors.</p>
<h3 id="refactoring-with-structs-adding-more-meaning"><a class="header" href="#refactoring-with-structs-adding-more-meaning">Refactoring with Structs: Adding More Meaning</a></h3>
<p>We use structs to add meaning by labeling the data. We can transform the tuple we're using into a struct with a name for
the whole as well as names for the parts, as shown in Listing 5-10.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">struct Rectangle {      // 1
    width: u32,         // 2
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {     // 3
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!(
        &quot;The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.&quot;,
        area(&amp;rect1)
    );
}

fn area(rectangle: &amp;Rectangle) -&gt; u32 {     // 4
    rectangle.width * rectangle.height      // 5
}</code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 5-10: Defining a <code>Rectangle</code> struct</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, we've defined a struct and named it <code>Rectangle</code> (1). Inside the curly brackets, we defined the fields as <code>width</code>
and <code>height</code>, both of which have type <code>u32</code> (2). Then, in <code>main</code>, we created a particular instance of <code>Rectangle</code> that
has a width of 30 and a height of 50 (3).</p>
<p>Our <code>area</code> function is now defined with one parameter, which we've named <code>rectangle</code>, whose type is an immutable borrow
of a struct <code>Rectangle</code> instance (4). As mentioned in Chapter 4, we want to borrow the struct rather than take ownership
of it. This way, <code>main</code> retains its ownership and can continue using <code>rect1</code>, which is the reason we use the <code>&amp;</code> in the
function signature and where we call the function.</p>
<p>The <code>area</code> function accesses the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> fields of the <code>Rectangle</code> instance (5) (note that accessing fields
of a borrowed struct instance does not move the field values, which is why you often see borrows of structs). Our
function signature for <code>area</code> now says exactly what we mean: calculate the area of <code>Rectangle</code>, using its <code>width</code>
and <code>height</code> fields. This conveys that the width and height are related to each other, and it gives descriptive names to
the values rather than using the tuple index values of 0 and 1. This is a win for clarity.</p>
<h3 id="adding-useful-functionality-with-derived-traits"><a class="header" href="#adding-useful-functionality-with-derived-traits">Adding Useful Functionality with Derived Traits</a></h3>
<p>It'd be useful to be able to print an instance of <code>Rectangle</code> while we're debugging our program and see the values for
all its fields. Listing 5-11 tries using the <code>println!</code> macro as we have used in previous chapters. This won't work,
however.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };
    
    println!(&quot;rect1 is {}&quot;, rect1);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>When we compile this code, we get an error with this core message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0277]: `Rectangle` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Display`
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>println!</code> macro can do many kinds of formatting, and by default, the curly brackets tell <code>println!</code> to use
formatting known as <code>Display</code>: output intended for direct end user consumption. The primitive types we've seen so far
implement <code>Display</code> by default because there's only one way you'd want to show a 1 or any other primitive type to a
user. But with structs, the way <code>println!</code> should format the output is less clear because there are more display
possibilities: Do you want commas or not? Do you want to print the curly brackets? Should all the fields be shown? Due
to this ambiguity, Rust doesn't try to guess what we want, and structs don't have a provided implementation of <code>Display</code>
to use with <code>println!</code> and the <code>{}</code> placeholder.</p>
<p>If we continue reading the errors, we'll find this helpful note:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">= help: the trait `std::fmt::Display` is not implemented for `Rectangle`
= note: in format strings you may be able to use `{:?}` (or {:#?} for pretty-print) instead
</code></pre>
<p>Let's try it! The <code>println!</code> macro call will now look like <code>println!(&quot;rect1 is {:?}&quot;, rect1);</code>. Putting the
specifier <code>:?</code> inside the curly brackets tells <code>println!</code> we want to use an output format called <code>Debug</code>. The <code>Debug</code>
trait enables us to print our struct in a way that is useful for developers so we can see its value while we're
debugging our code.</p>
<p>Compile the code with this change. Drat! We still get an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0277]: `Rectangle` doesn't implement `Debug`
</code></pre>
<p>But again, the compiler gives us a helpful note:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">= help: the trait `Debug` is not implemented for `Rectangle`
= note: add `#[derive(Debug)]` to `Rectangle` or manually `impl Debug for Rectangle`
</code></pre>
<p>Rust does include functionality to print out debugging information, but we have to explicitly opt in to make that
functionality available for our struct. To do that, we add the outer attribute <code>#[derive(Debug)]</code> just before the struct
definition, as shown in Listing 5-12.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!(&quot;rect1 is {:?}&quot;, rect1);
}</code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 5-12: Adding the attribute to derive the <code>Debug</code> trait and printing the <code>Rectangle</code> instance using debug
formatting</li>
</ul>
<p>Now when we run the program, we won't get any errors, and we'll see the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">rect1 is Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 }
</code></pre>
<p>Nice! It's not the prettiest output, but it shows the values of all the fields for this instance, which would definitely
help during debugging. When we have larger structs, it's useful to have output that's a bit easier to read; in those
cases, we can use <code>{:#?}</code> instead of <code>{:?}</code> in the <code>println!</code> string. In this example, using the <code>{:#?}</code> style will
output the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">rect1 is Rectangle {
    width: 30,
    height: 50,
}
</code></pre>
<p>Another way to print out a value using the <code>Debug</code> format is to use the <code>dbg!</code> macro, which takes ownership of an
expression (as opposed to <code>println!</code>, which takes a reference), prints the file and line number of where that <code>dbg!</code>
macro call occurs in your code along with the resultant value of that expression, and returns ownership of the value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Calling the <code>dbg!</code> macro prints to the standard error console stream (<code>stderr</code>), as opposed to <code>println!</code>, which
prints to the standard output console stream (<code>stdout</code>). We'll talk more about <code>stderr</code> and <code>stdout</code> in &quot;Writing Error
Messages to Standard Error Instead of Standard Output&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's an example where we're interested in the value that gets assigned to the <code>width</code> field, as well as the value of
the whole struct in <code>rect1</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let scale = 2;
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: dbg!(30 * scale),    // 1
        height: 50,
    };
    
    dbg!(&amp;rect1);       // 2

<p>We can put <code>dbg!</code> around the expression <code>30 * scale</code> (1) and, because <code>dbg!</code> returns ownership of the expression's
value, the <code>width</code> field will get the same value as if we didn't have the <code>dbg!</code> call there. We don't want <code>dbg!</code> to
take ownership of <code>rect1</code>, so we use a reference to <code>rect1</code> in the next call (2). Here's what the output of this example
looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[src\main.rs:27] 30 * scale = 60
[src\main.rs:31] &amp;rect1 = Rectangle {
    width: 60,
    height: 50,
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can see the first bit of output came from (1) where we're debugging the expression <code>30 * scale</code>, and its resultant
value is 60 (the <code>Debug</code> formatting implemented for integers is to print only their value). The <code>dbg!</code> call at (2)
outputs the value of <code>&amp;rect1</code>, which is the <code>Rectangle</code> struct. This output uses the pretty <code>Debug</code> formatting of
the <code>Rectangle</code> type. The <code>dbg!</code> macro can be really helpful when you're trying to figure out what your code is doing!</p>
<p>In addition to the <code>Debug</code> trait, Rust has provided a number of traits for us to use with the <code>derive</code> attribute that
can add useful behavior to our custom types. Those traits and their behaviors are listed in Appendix C. We'll cover how
to implement these traits with custom behavior as well as how to create your own traits in Chapter 10. There are also
many attributes other than <code>derive</code>; for more information, see the &quot;Attributes&quot; section of the Rust Reference
at https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes.html.</p>
<p>Our <code>area</code> function is very specific: it only computes the area of rectangles. It would be helpful to tie this behavior
more closely to our <code>Rectangle</code> struct because it won't work with any other type. Let's look at how we can continue to
refactor this code by turning the <code>area</code> function into an <code>area</code> method defined on our <code>Rectangle</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="method-syntax"><a class="header" href="#method-syntax">Method Syntax</a></h2>
<p>Methods are similar to functions: we declare them with the <code>fn</code> keyword and a name, they can have parameters and a
return value, and they contain some code that's run when the method is called from somewhere else. Unlike functions,
methods are defined within the context of a struct (or an enum or a trait object, which we cover in Chapter 6 and
Chapter 17, respectively), and their first parameter is always <code>self</code>, which represents the instance of the struct the
method is being called on.</p>
<h3 id="defining-methods"><a class="header" href="#defining-methods">Defining Methods</a></h3>
<p>Let's change the <code>area</code> function that has a <code>Rectangle</code> instance as a parameter and instead make an <code>area</code> method
defined on the <code>Rectangle</code> struct, as shown in Listing 5-13.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {                    // 1
    fn area(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 {         // 2
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!(
        &quot;The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.&quot;,
        rect1.area()        // 3
    );
}</code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 5-13: Defining an <code>area</code> method on the <code>Rectangle</code> struct</li>
</ul>
<p>To define the function within the context of <code>Rectangle</code>, we start an <code>impl</code>(implementation) block for <code>Rectangle</code> (1).
Everything within this <code>impl</code> block will be associated with the <code>Rectangle</code> type. Then we move the <code>area</code> function
within the <code>impl</code> curly brackets (2) and change the first (and in this case, only) parameter to be <code>self</code> in the
signature and everywhere with the body. In <code>main</code>, where we called the <code>area</code> function and passed <code>rect1</code> as an
argument, we can instead use method syntax to call the <code>area</code> method on our <code>Rectangle</code> instance (3). The method syntax
goes after an instance: we add a dot followed by the method name, parentheses, and any arguments.</p>
<p>In the signature for <code>area</code>, we use <code>&amp;self</code> instead of <code>rectangle</code>: <code>&amp;Rectangle</code>. The <code>&amp;self</code> is actually short
for <code>self</code>: <code>&amp;Self</code>. Within an <code>impl</code> block, the type <code>Self</code> is an alias for the type that the <code>impl</code> block is for.
Methods must have a parameter named <code>self</code> of type <code>Self</code> for their first parameter, so Rust lets you abbreviate this
with only the name <code>self</code> in the first parameter spot. Note that we still need to use the <code>&amp;</code> in front of the <code>self</code>
shorthand to indicate that this method borrows the <code>Self</code> instance, just as we did in <code>rectangle</code>: <code>&amp;Rectangle</code>. Methods
can take ownership of <code>self</code>, borrow <code>self</code> immutably, as we've done here, or borrow <code>self</code> mutably, just as they can
any other parameter.</p>
<p>We chose <code>&amp;self</code> here for the same reason we used <code>&amp;Rectangle</code> in the function version: we don't want to take ownership,
and we just want to read the data in the struct, not write to it. If we wanted to change the instance that we've called
the method on as part of what the method does, we'd use <code>&amp;mut self</code> as the first parameter. Having a method that takes
ownership of the instance by using just <code>self</code> as the first parameter is rare; this technique is usually used when the
method transforms <code>self</code> into something else and you want to prevent the caller from using the original instance after
the transformation.</p>
<p>The main reason for using methods instead of functions, in addition to providing method syntax and not having to repeat
the type of <code>self</code> in every method's signature, is for organization. We've put all the things we can do with an instance
of a type in one <code>impl</code> block rather than making future users of our code search for capabilities of <code>Rectangle</code> in
various places in the library we provide.</p>
<p>Note that we can choose to give a method the same name as one of the struct's fields. For example, we can define a
method on <code>Rectangle</code> that is also named <code>width</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021">#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn width(&amp;self) -&gt; bool {
        self.width &gt; 0
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    if rect1.width() {
        println!(
            &quot;The rectangle has a nonzero width; it is {}&quot;,
            rect1.width
        );
    }
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, we're choosing to make the <code>width</code> method return <code>true</code> if the value in the instance's <code>width</code> field is greater
than 0 and <code>false</code> if the value is 0: we can use a field within a method of the same name for any purpose. In <code>main</code>,
when we follow <code>rect1.width</code> with parentheses, Rust knows we mean the method <code>width</code>. When we don't use parentheses,
Rust knows we mean the field <code>width</code>.</p>
<p>Often, but not always, when we give methods with the same name as a field we want it to only return the value in the
field and do nothing else. Methods like this are called getters, and Rust does not implement them automatically for
struct fields as some other languages do. Getters are useful because you can make the field private but the method
public, and thus enable read-only access to that field as part of the type's public API. We will discuss what public and
private are and how to designate a field or method as public or private in Chapter 7.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="wheres-the---operator"><a class="header" href="#wheres-the---operator">Where's the <code>-&gt;</code> operator?</a></h4>
<p>In C and C++, two different operators are used for calling methods: you use <code>.</code> if you're calling a method on the
object directly and <code>-&gt;</code> if you're calling the method on a pointer to the object and need to dereference the pointer
first. In other words, if <code>object</code> is a pointer, <code>object-&gt;something()</code> is similar to <code>(*object).something()</code>.</p>
<p>Rust doesn't have an equivalent to the <code>-&gt;</code> operator; instead, Rust has a featured called automatic referencing and
dereferencing. Calling methods is one of the few places in Rust that has this behavior.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: when you call a method with <code>object.something()</code>, Rust automatically adds in <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&amp;mut</code>, or <code>*</code>
so <code>object</code> matches the signature of the method. In other words, the following are the same:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">p1.distance(&amp;p2);
(&amp;p1).distance(&amp;p2);</code></pre>
<p>The first one looks much cleaner. This automatic referencing behavior works because methods have a clear receiver -
the type of <code>self</code>. Given the receiver and name of a method, Rust can figure out definitively whether the method is
reading (<code>&amp;self</code>), mutating (<code>&amp;mut self</code>), or consuming (<code>self</code>). The fact that Rust makes borrowing implicit for method
receivers is a big part of making ownership ergonomic in practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="methods-with-more-parameters"><a class="header" href="#methods-with-more-parameters">Methods with More Parameters</a></h3>
<p>Let's practice using methods by implementing a second method on the <code>Rectangle</code> struct. This time we want an instance
of <code>Rectangle</code> to take another instance of <code>Rectangle</code> and return <code>ture</code> if the second <code>Rectangle</code> can fit completely
within <code>self</code> (the first <code>Rectangle</code>); otherwise, it should return <code>false</code>. That is, once we've defined the <code>can_hold</code>
method, we want to be able to write the program shown in Listing 5-14.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,

    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };
    let rect2 = Rectangle {
        width: 10,
        height: 40,
    };
    let rect3 = Rectangle {
        width: 60,
        height: 45,
    };

    println!(&quot;Can rect1 hold rect2? {}&quot;, rect1.can_hold(&amp;rect2));
    println!(&quot;Can rect2 hold rect3? {}&quot;, rect1.can_hold(&amp;rect3));
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 5-14: Using the as-yet-unwritten <code>can_hold</code> method</li>
</ul>
<p>The expected output would look like the following because both dimensions of <code>rect1</code>, but <code>rect3</code> is wider than <code>rect1</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Can rect1 hold rect2? true
Can rect2 hold rect3? false
</code></pre>
<p>We know we want to define a method, so it will be within the <code>impl Rectangle</code> block. The method name will be <code>can_hold</code>,
and it will take an immutable borrow of nother <code>Rectangle</code> as a parameter. We can tell what the type of the parameter
will be by looking at the code that calls the method: <code>rect1.can_hold(&amp;rect2)</code> passes in <code>&amp;rect2</code>, which is an immutable
borrow to <code>rect2</code>, an instance of <code>Rectangle</code>. This makes sense because we only need to read <code>rect2</code> (rather than write,
which would mean we'd need a mutable borrow), and we want <code>main</code> to retain ownership of <code>rect2</code> so we can use it again
after calling the <code>can_hold</code> method. The return value of <code>can_hold</code> will be a Boolean, and the implementation will check
whether the width and height of <code>self</code> are greater than the width and height of the other <code>Rectangle</code>, respectively.
Let's add the new <code>can_hold</code> method to the <code>impl</code> block from Listing 5-13, shown in Listing 5-15.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">#[derive(Debug)]

    }

}</code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 5-15: Implementing the <code>can_hold</code> method on <code>Rectangle</code> that takes another <code>Rectangle</code> instance as a parameter</li>
</ul>
<p>When we run this code with the <code>main</code> function in Listing 5-14, we'll get our desired output. Methods can take multiple
parameters that we add to the signature after the <code>self</code> parameter, and those parameters work just like parameters in
functions.</p>
<h3 id="associated-functions"><a class="header" href="#associated-functions">Associated Functions</a></h3>
<p>All functions defined within an <code>impl</code> block are called associated functions because they're associated with the type
named after the <code>impl</code>. We can define associated functions that don't have <code>self</code> as their first parameter (and thus are
not methods) because they don't need an instance of the type to work with. We've already used one function like this:
the <code>String::from</code> function that's defined on the <code>String</code> type.</p>
<p>Associated functions that aren't methods are often used for constructors that will return a new instance of the struct.
These are often called <code>new</code>, but <code>new</code> isn't a special name and isn't built into the language. For example, we could
choose to provide an associated function named <code>square</code> that would have one dimension parameter and use that as both
width and height, thus making it easier to create a square <code>Rectangle</code> rather than having to specify the same value
twice:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">impl Rectangle {
    fn square(size: u32) -&gt; Self {  // 1
        Self {                      // 2
            width: size,
            height: size,
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Self</code> keywords in the return type (1) and in the body of the function (2) are aliases for the type that appears
after the <code>impl</code> keyword, which in this case is <code>Rectangle</code>.</p>
<p>To call this associated function, we use the <code>::</code> syntax with the struct name; <code>let sq = Rectangle::square(3);</code> is an
example. This function is namespaced by the struct: the <code>::</code> syntax is used for both associated functions and namespaces
created by modules. We'll discuss modules in Chapter 7.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-impl-blocks"><a class="header" href="#multiple-impl-blocks">Multiple impl Blocks</a></h3>
<p>Each struct is allowed to have multiple <code>impl</code> blocks. For example, Listing 5-15 is equivalent to the code shown in
Listing 5-16, which has each method in its own <code>impl</code> block.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn can_hold(&amp;self, other: &amp;Rectangle) -&gt; bool {
        self.width &gt; other.width &amp;&amp; self.height &gt; other.height
    }
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 5-16: Rewriting Listing 5-15 using multiple <code>impl</code> blocks</li>
</ul>
<p>There's no reason to separate these methods into multiple <code>impl</code> blocks here, but this is valid syntax. We'll see a case
in which multiple <code>impl</code> blocks are useful in Chapter 10, where we discuss generic types and traits.</p>
<h2 id="summary-4"><a class="header" href="#summary-4">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Structs let you create custom types that are meaningful for your domain. By using structs, you can keep associated
pieces of data connected to each other and name each piece to make your code clear. In <code>impl</code> blocks, you can define
functions that are associated with your type, and methods are a kind of associated function that let you specify the
behavior that instances of your structs have.</p>
<p>But structs aren't the only way you can create custom types: let's turn to Rust's enum feature to add another tool to
your toolbox. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="enums-and-pattern-matching"><a class="header" href="#enums-and-pattern-matching">Enums and Pattern Matching</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter, we'll look at enumerations, also referred to as <code>enums</code>. Enums allow you to define a type by
enumerating its possible variants. First we'll define and use an enum to show how an enum can encode meaning along with
data. Next, we'll explore a particularly useful enum, called <code>Option</code>, which expresses that a value can be either
something or nothing. Then we'll look at how pattern matching in the <code>match</code> expression makes it easy to run different
code for different values of an enum. Finally, we'll cover how the <code>if let</code> construct is another convenient and concise
idiom available to handle enums in your code.</p>
<h2 id="defining-an-enum"><a class="header" href="#defining-an-enum">Defining an Enum</a></h2>
<p>Where structs give you a way of grouping together related fields and data, like a <code>Rectangle</code> with its <code>width</code>
and <code>height</code>, enums give you a way of saying a value is one of a possible set of values. For example, we may want to say
that <code>Rectangle</code> is one of a set of possible shapes that also includes <code>Circle</code> and <code>Triangle</code>. To do this, Rust allows
us to encode these possibilities as an enum.
Let's look at a situation we might want to express in code and see why enums are useful and more appropriate than
structs in this case. Say we need to work with IP addresses. Currently, two major standards are used for IP addresses:
version four and version six. Because these are the only possibilities for an IP address that our program will come
across, we can enumerate all possible variants, which is where enumeration gets its name.</p>
<p>Any IP address can be either a version four or a version six address, but not both at the same time. That property of IP
addresses makes the enum data structure appropriate because an enum value can only be one of its variants. Both version
four and version six addresses are still fundamentally IP addresses, so they should be treated as the same type when the
code is handling situations that apply to any kind of IP address.</p>
<p>We can express this concept in code by defining an <code>IpAddrKind</code> enumeration and listing the possible kinds an IP address
can be, <code>V4</code> and <code>V6</code>. These are the variants of the enum:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}</code></pre>
<p><code>IpAddrKind</code> is now a custom data type that we can use elsewhere in our code.</p>
<h3 id="enum-values"><a class="header" href="#enum-values">Enum Values</a></h3>
<p>We can create instances of each of the two variants of <code>IpAddrKind</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
let six = IpAddrKind::V6;</code></pre>
<p>Note that the variants of the enum are namespaced under its identifier, and we use a double colon to separate the two.
This is useful because now both values <code>IpAddrKind::V4</code> and <code>IpAddrKind::V6</code> are of the same type: <code>IpAddrKind</code>. We can
then, for instance, define a function that takes any <code>IpAddrKind</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}</code></pre>
<p>And we can call this function with either variant:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">route(IpAddrKind::V4);
route(IpAddrKind::V6);</code></pre>
<p>Using enums has even more advantages. Thinking more about our IP address type, at the moment we don't have a way to
store the actual IP address data; we only know that kind it is. Given that you just learned about struct in Chapter 5,
you might be tempted to tackle this problem with structs as shown in Listing 6-1.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">enum IpAddrKind {       // 1
    V4,
    V6,
}

struct IpAddr {         // 2
    kind: IpAddrKind,   // 3
    address: String,    // 4
}

fn main() {
    let home = IpAddr {         // 5
        kind: IpAddrKind::V4,
        address: String::from(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;),
    };

    let loopback = IpAddr {     // 6
        kind: IpAddrKind::V6,
        address: String::from(&quot;::1&quot;),
    };
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 6-1: Storing the data and <code>IpAddrKind</code> variant of an IP address using a <code>struct</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Here, we've defined a struct <code>IpAddr</code> (2) that has two fields: a <code>kind</code> field (3) that is of type <code>IpAddrKind</code> (the enum
we defined previously (1)) and an <code>address</code> field (4) of type <code>String</code>. We have two instances of this struct. The first
is <code>home</code> (5), and it has the value <code>IpAddrKind::V4</code> as its <code>kind</code> with associated address data of <code>127.0.0.1</code>. The
second instance is <code>loopback</code> (6). It has the other variant of <code>IpAddrKind</code> as its <code>kind</code> value, <code>V6</code>, and has
address <code>::1</code> associated with it. We've used a struct to bundle the <code>kind</code> and <code>address</code> values together, so now the
variant is associated with the value.</p>
<p>However, representing the same concept using just an enum is more concise: rather than an enum inside a struct, we can
put data directly into each enum variant. This new definition of the <code>IpAddr</code> enum says that both <code>V4</code> and <code>V6</code> variants
will have associated <code>String</code> values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">enum IpAddr {
    V4(String),
    V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;));

let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from(&quot;::1&quot;));</code></pre>
<p>We attach data to each variant of the enum directly, so there is no need for an extra struct. Here, it's also easier to
see another detail of how enums work: the name of each enum variant that we define also becomes a function that
constructs an instance of the enum. That is, <code>IpAddr::V4()</code> is a function call that takes a <code>String</code> argument and
returns an instance of the <code>IpAddr</code> type. We automatically get this constructor function defined as a result of defining
the enum.</p>
<p>There's another advantage to using an enum rather than a struct: each variant can have different types and amounts of
associated data. Version four IP addresses will always have four numeric components that will have values between 0 and</p>
<ol start="255">
<li>If we wanted to store <code>V4</code> addresses as four <code>u8</code> values but still express <code>V6</code> addresses as one <code>String</code> value, we
wouldn't be able to with a struct. Enums handle this case with ease:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">enum IpAddr {
    V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
    V6(String),
}

fn main() {
    let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);
    
    let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from(&quot;::1&quot;));
}</code></pre>
<p>We've shown several different ways to define data structures to store version four and version six IP addresses.
However, as it turns out, wanting to store IP addresses and encode which kind they are is so common that the standard
library has a definition we can use! Let's look at how the standard library defines <code>IpAddr</code>: it has the exact enum and
variants that we've defined and used, but it embeds the address data inside the variants in the form of two different
structs, which are defined differently for each variant:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">struct Ipv4Addr {
    --snip--
}

struct Ipv6Addr {
    --snip--
}

enum IpAddr {
    V4(Ipv4Addr),
    V6(Ipv6Addr),
}</code></pre>
<p>This code illustrates that you can put any kind of data inside an enum variant: strings, numeric types, or structs, for
example. You can even include another enum! Also, standard library types are often not much more complicated than what
you might come up with.</p>
<p>Note that even though the standard library contains a definition for <code>IpAddr</code>, we can still create and use our own
definition without conflict because we haven't brought the standard library's definition into our scope. We'll talk more
about bringing types into scope in Chapter 7.</p>
<p>Let's look at another example of an enum in Listing 6-2: this one has a wide variety of types embedded in its variants.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 6-2: A <code>Message</code> enum whose variants each store different amounts and types of values</li>
</ul>
<p>This enum has four variants with different types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Quit</code> Has no data associated with it at all</li>
<li><code>Move</code> Has named fields, like a struct does</li>
<li><code>Write</code> Includes a single <code>String</code></li>
<li><code>ChangeColor</code> Includes three <code>i32</code> values</li>
</ul>
<p>Defining an enum with variants such as the ones in Listing 6-2 is similar to defining different kinds of struct
definitions, except the enum doesn't use the <code>struct</code> keyword and all the variants are grouped together under
the <code>Message</code> type. The following structs could hold the same data that the preceding enum variants hold:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">struct QuitMessage;  // unit struct
struct MoveMessage {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
struct WriteMessage(String);  // tuple struct
struct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32);  // tuple struct</code></pre>
<p>But if we used the different structs, each of which has its own type, we couldn't as easily define a function to take
any of these kinds of messages as we could with the <code>Message</code> enum defined in Listing 6-2, which is a single type.</p>
<p>There is one more similarity between enums and structs: just as we're able to define methods on structs using <code>impl</code>,
we're also able to define methods on enums. Here's a method named <code>call</code> that we could define on our <code>Message</code> enum:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">impl Message {
    fn call(&amp;self) {
        // method body would be defined here    // 1
    }
}

fn main() {
    let m = Message::Write(String::from(&quot;hello&quot;));  // 2
    m.call();
}</code></pre>
<p>The body of the method would use <code>self</code> to get the value that we called the method on. In this example, we've created a
variable <code>m</code> (2) that has the value <code>Message::Write(String::from(&quot;hello&quot;))</code>, and that is what <code>self</code> will be in the body
of the <code>call</code> method (1) when <code>m.call()</code> runs.</p>
<p>Let's look at another enum in the standard library that is very common and useful: <code>Option</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-option-enum-and-its-advantages-over-null-values"><a class="header" href="#the-option-enum-and-its-advantages-over-null-values">The Option Enum and Its Advantages Over Null Values</a></h3>
<p>This section explores a case study of <code>Option</code>, which is another enum defined by the standard library. The <code>Option</code> type
encodes the very common scenario in which a value could be something or it could be nothing.</p>
<p>For example, if you request the first item in a list containing multiple items, you would get a value. If you request
the first item in an empty list, you would get nothing. Expressing this concept in terms of the type system means the
compiler can check whether you've handled all the cases you should be handling; this functionality can prevent bugs that
are extremely common in other programming languages.</p>
<p>Programming language design is often though of in terms of which features you include but the features you exclude are
important too. Rust doesn't have the null feature that many other languages have. Null is a value that means there is no
value there. In languages with null, variables can always be in one of two states: null or not-null.</p>
<p>In his 2009 presentation &quot;Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake,&quot; Tonay Hoare, the inventor of null, had this to
say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I call it my billion-dollor mistake. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references
in an object-oriented language. My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with
checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn't resis the temptation to put in a null reference,
simply
because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which
have
probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem with null values is that if you try to use a null value as a not-null value, you'll get an error of some
kind. Because this null or not-null property is pervasive, it's extremely easy to make this kind of error.</p>
<p>However, the concept that null is trying to express is still a useful one: a null is a value that is currently invalid
or absent for some reason.</p>
<p>The problem isn't really with the concept but with the particular implementation. As such, Rust does not have nulls, but
it does have an enum that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent. This enum is <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, and it is
defined by the standrad library as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">enum Option&lt;T&gt; {
    None,
    Some(T),
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum is so useful that it's even included in the prelude; you don't need to bring it into scope
explicitly. Its variants are also included in the prelude: you can use <code>Some</code> and <code>None</code> directly without the <code>Option::</code>
prefix. The <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum is still just a regular enum, and <code>Some(T)</code> and <code>None</code> are still variants of
type <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> syntax is a feature of Rust we haven't talked about yet. It's a generic type parameter, and we'll cover
generics in more detail in Chapter 10. For now, all you need to know is that <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> means that the <code>Some</code> variant of
the <code>Option</code> enum can hold one piece of data of any type, and that each concrete type that gets used in place of <code>T</code>
makes the overall <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> type a different type. Here are some examples of using <code>Option</code> values to hold number
types and string types:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let some_number = Some(5);
    let some_char = Some('e');
    
    let absent_number: Option&lt;i32&gt; = None;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre>
<p>The type of <code>some_number</code> is <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code>. The type of <code>some_char</code> is <code>Option&lt;char&gt;</code>, which is a different type. Rust
can infer these types because we've specified a value inside the <code>Some</code> variant. For <code>absent_number</code>, Rust requires us
to annotate the overall <code>Option</code> type: the compiler can't infer the type that the corresponding <code>Some</code> variant will hold
by looking only at a <code>None</code> value. Here, we tall Rust that we mean for <code>absent_number</code> to be of type <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>When we have a <code>Some</code> value, we know that a value is present and the value is held within the <code>Some</code>. When we have
a <code>None</code> value, in some sense it means the same thing as null: we don't have a valid value. So why is having <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>
any better than having null?</p>
<p>In short, because <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>T</code> (where <code>T</code> can be any type) are different types, the compiler won't let us use
an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> value as if it were definitely a valid value. For example, this code won't compile, because it's trying
to add an <code>i8</code> to an <code>Option&lt;i8&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let x: i8 = 5;
    let y: Option&lt;i8&gt; = Some(5);
    
    let sum = x + y;
}</code></pre>
<p>If we run this code, we get an error message like this one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0277]: cannot add `Option&lt;i8&gt;` to `i8`
 --&gt; src\main.rs:5:17
  |
5 |     let sum = x + y;
  |                 ^ no implementation for `i8 + Option&lt;i8&gt;`
  |
  = help: the trait `Add&lt;Option&lt;i8&gt;&gt;` is not implemented for `i8`
</code></pre>
<p>Intense! In effect, this error message means that Rust doesn't understand how to add an <code>i8</code> and an <code>Option&lt;i8&gt;</code>,
because they're different types. When we have a value of a type like <code>i8</code> in Rust, the compiler will ensure that we
always have a valid value. We can proceed confidently without having to check for null before using that value. Only
when we have an <code>Option&lt;i8&gt;</code>(or whatever type of value we're working with) do we have to worry about possibly not having
a value, and the compiler will make sure we handle that case before using the value.</p>
<p>In other words, you have to convert an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> to a <code>T</code> before you can perform <code>T</code> operations with it. Generally,
this helps catch one of the most common issues with null: assuming that something isn't null when it actually is.</p>
<p>Eliminating the rist of incorrectly assuming a not-null value helps you to be more confident in your code. In order to
have a value that can possibly be null, you must explicitly opt in by making the type of that value <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>. Then,
when you use that value, you are required to explicitly handle the case when the value is null. Everywhere that a value
has a type that isn't an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, you can safely assume that the value isn't null. This was a deliberate design
decision for Rust to limit null's pervasiveness and increase the safety of Rust code.</p>
<p>So how do you get the <code>T</code> value out of a <code>Some</code> variant when you have a value of type <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> so that you can use
that value? The <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum has a large number of methods that are useful in a variety of situations; you can check
them out in its documentation. Becoming familiar with the methods on <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> will be extremely useful in your
journey with Rust.</p>
<p>In general, in order to use an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> value, you want to have code that will handle each variant. You want some
code that will run only when you have a <code>Some(T)</code> value, and this code is allowed to use the inner <code>T</code>. You want some
other code to run only if you have a <code>None</code> value, and that code doesn't have a <code>T</code> value available. The <code>match</code>
expression is a control flow construct that does just this when used with enums: it will run different code depending on
which variant of the enum it has, and that code can use the data inside the matching value.</p>
<h2 id="the-match-control-flow-construct"><a class="header" href="#the-match-control-flow-construct">The match Control Flow Construct</a></h2>
<p>Rust has an extremely powerful control flow construct called <code>match</code> that allows you to compare a value against a series
of patterns and then execute code based on which pattern matches. Patterns can be made up of literal values, variable
names, wildcards, and many other things; Chapter 18 covers all the different kinds of patterns and what they do. The
power of <code>match</code> comes from the expressiveness of the patterns and the fact that the compiler confirms that all possible
cases are handled.</p>
<p>Think of a <code>match</code> expression as being like a coin-sorting machine: coins slide down a track with variously sized holes
along it, and each coin falls through the first hole it encounters that it fits into. In the same way, values go through
each pattern in a <code>match</code>, and at the first pattern the value &quot;fits,&quot; the value falls into the associated code block to
be used during execution.</p>
<p>Speaking of coins, let's use them as an example using <code>match</code>! We can write a function that takes an unknown US coin
and, in a similar way as the counting machine determines which coint it is and returns its value in cents, as shown in
Listing 6-3.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">enum Coin {     // 1
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -&gt; u8 {
    match coin {                // 2
        Coin::Penny =&gt; 1,       // 3
        Coin::Nickel =&gt; 5,
        Coin::Dime =&gt; 10,
        Coin::Quarter =&gt; 25,
    }
}

fn main() {}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 6-3: An enum and a match expression that has the variants of the enum as its patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's break down the <code>match</code> in the <code>value_in_cents</code> function. First we list the <code>match</code> keyword followed by an
expression, which in this case is the value <code>coin</code> (2). This seems very similar to an expression used with <code>if</code>, but
there's a big difference: with <code>if</code>, the expression needs to return a Boolean value, but here it can return any type.
The type of <code>coin</code> in this example is the <code>Coin</code> enum that was defined at (1).</p>
<p>Next are the <code>match</code> arms. An arm has two parts: a pattern and some code. The first arm here has a pattern that is the
value <code>Coin::Penny</code> and then the <code>=&gt;</code> operator that separates the pattern and the code to run (3). The code in this case
is just the value 1. Each arm is separated from the next with a comma.</p>
<p>When the <code>match</code> expression executes, it compares the resultant value against the pattern of each arm, in order. If a
pattern matches the value, the code associated with that pattern is executed. If that pattern doesn't match the value,
execution continues to the next arm, such as in a coin-sorting machine. We can have as many arms as we need: in Listing
6-3, our <code>match</code> has four arms.</p>
<p>The code associated with each arm is an expression, and the resultant value of the expression in the matching arm is the
value that gets returned for the entire <code>match</code> expression.</p>
<p>We don't typically use curly brackets if the match arm code is short, as it is in Listing 6-3 where each arm just
returns a value. If you want to run multiple lines of code in a match arm, you must use curly brackets, and the comma
following the arm is then optional. For example, the following code prints &quot;Lucky penny!&quot; every time the method is
called with a <code>Coin::Penny</code>, but still returns the last value of the block, 1:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -&gt; u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny =&gt; {
            println!(&quot;Lucky penny!&quot;);
            1
        }
        Coin::Nickel =&gt; 5,
        Coin::Dime =&gt; 10,
        Coin::Quarter =&gt; 25,
    }
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="patterns-that-bind-to-values"><a class="header" href="#patterns-that-bind-to-values">Patterns That Bind to Values</a></h3>
<p>Another useful feature of match arms is that they can bind to the parts of the values that match the pattern. This is
how we can extract values out of enum variants.</p>
<p>As an example, let's change one of our enum variants to hold data inside it. From 1999 through 2008, the United States
minted quarters with different designs for each of the 50 states on one side. No other coins got state designs, so only
quarters have this extra value. We can add this information to our <code>enum</code> by changing the <code>Quarter</code> variant to include
a <code>UsState</code> value stored inside it, which we've done in Listing 6-4.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">#[derive(Debug)]
enum UsState {
    Alabama,
    Alaska,
    // snip
}

enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter(UsState),
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 6-4: A <code>Coin</code> enum in which the <code>Quarter</code> variant also holds a <code>UsState</code> value</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's imagine that a friend is trying to collect all 50 state quarters. While we sort our loose change by coin type,
we'll also call out the name of the state associated with each quarter so that if it's one our friend doesn't have, they
can add it to their collection.</p>
<p>In the match expression for this code, we add a variable called <code>state</code> to the pattern that matches values of the
variant <code>Coin::Quarter</code>. When a <code>Coin::Quarter</code> matches, the <code>state</code> variable will bind to the value of that quarter's
state. Then we can use <code>state</code> in the code for that arm, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground"><span class="boring">#[derive(Debug)]
</span><span class="boring">enum UsState {
</span><span class="boring">    Alabama,
</span><span class="boring">    Alaska,
</span><span class="boring">    // snip
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">enum Coin {
</span><span class="boring">    Penny,
</span><span class="boring">    Nickel,
</span><span class="boring">    Dime,
</span><span class="boring">    Quarter(UsState),
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span>fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -&gt; u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny =&gt; 1,
        Coin::Nickel =&gt; 5,
        Coin::Dime =&gt; 10,
        Coin::Quarter(state) =&gt; {
            println!(&quot;State quarter from {:?}!&quot;, state);
            25
        },
    }
}
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {}</span></code></pre>
<p>If we were to call <code>value_in_cents(Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska))</code>, <code>coin</code> would be <code>Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska)</code>.
When we compare that value with each of the match arms, none of them match until we reach <code>Coin::Quarter(state)</code>. At
that point, the binding for <code>state</code> will be the value <code>UsState::Alaska</code>. We can then use that binding in the <code>println!</code>
expression, thus getting the inner state value out of the <code>Coin</code> enum variant for <code>Quarter</code>.</p>
<h3 id="matching-with-option"><a class="header" href="#matching-with-option">Matching with Option<T></a></h3>
<p>In the previous section, we wanted to get the inner <code>T</code> value out of the <code>Some</code> case when using <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>; we can also
handle <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> using <code>match</code>, as we did with the <code>Coin</code> enum! Instead of comparing coins, we'll compare the variants
of <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, but the way the <code>match</code> expression works remains the same.</p>
<p>Let's say we want to write a function that takes an <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code> and, if there's a value inside, adds 1 to that value.
If there isn't a value inside the function should return the <code>None</code> value and not attempt to perform any operations.</p>
<p>This functions is very easy to write, thanks to <code>match</code>, and will look like Listing 6-5.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn plus_one(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;i32&gt; {
    match x {
        None =&gt; None,               // 1
        Some(i) =&gt; Some(i + 1),     // 2
    }
}

fn main() {
    let five = Some(5);
    let six = plus_one(five);       // 3
    let none = plus_one(None);      // 4
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 6-5: A function that uses a <code>match</code> expression on an <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Let's examine the first execution of <code>plus_one</code> in more detail. When we call <code>plus_one(five)</code> (3), the variable <code>x</code> in
the body of <code>plus_one</code> will have the value <code>Some(5)</code>. We then compare that against each match arm:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">None =&gt; None,</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Some(5)</code> value doesn't match the pattern <code>None</code> (1), so we continue to the next arm:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">Some(i) =&gt; Some(i + 1),</code></pre>
<p>Does <code>Some(5)</code> match <code>Some(i)</code> (2)? Why yes, it does! We have the same variant. The <code>i</code> binds to the value contained
in <code>Some</code>, so <code>i</code> takes the value <code>5</code>. The code in the match arm is then executed, so we add 1 to the value of <code>i</code> and
create a new <code>Some</code> value with our total 6 inside.</p>
<p>Now let's consider the second call of <code>plus_one</code> in Listing 6-5, where <code>x</code> is <code>None</code> (4). We enter the <code>match</code> and
compare to the first arm (1).</p>
<p>It matches! There's no value to add to, so the program stops and returns the <code>None</code> value on the right side of <code>=&gt;</code>.
Because the first arm matched, no other arms are compared.</p>
<p>Combining <code>match</code> and enums is useful in many situations. You'll see this pattern a lot in Rust code: <code>match</code> against an
enum, bind a variable to the data inside, and then execute code based on it. It's a bit tricky at first, but once you
get used to it, you'll wish you had it in all languages. It's consistently a user favorite.</p>
<h3 id="matches-are-exhaustive"><a class="header" href="#matches-are-exhaustive">Matches are Exhaustive</a></h3>
<p>There's one other aspect of <code>match</code> we need to discuss: the
arms<code>patterns must cover all possibilities. Consider this version of our</code>plus_one` function, which has a bug and won't
compile:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn plus_one(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;i32&gt; {
    match x {
        Some(i) =&gt; Some(i + 1),
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>We didn't handle the <code>None</code> case, so this code will cause a bug. Luckily, it's a bug Rust knows how to catch. If we try
to compile this code, we'll get this error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: `None` not covered
   --&gt; src\main.rs:2:11
    |

    |
note: `Option&lt;i32&gt;` defined here
    = note: the matched value is of type `Option&lt;i32&gt;`

3   ~         Some(i) =&gt; Some(i + 1),
4   ~         None =&gt; todo!(),
    |
</code></pre>
<p>Rust knows that we didn't cover every possible case, and even knows which pattern we forgot! Matches in Rust are
exhaustive: we must exhaust every last possibility in order for the code to be valid. Especially in the case
of <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, when Rust prevents us from forgetting to explicitly handle the <code>None</code> case, it protects us from assuming
that we have a value when we might have null, thus making the billion-dollar mistake discussed earlier impossible.</p>
<h3 id="catch-all-patterns-and-the-_-placeholder"><a class="header" href="#catch-all-patterns-and-the-_-placeholder">Catch-All Patterns and the _ Placeholder</a></h3>
<p>Using enums, we can also take special actions for a few particular values, but for all other values take one default
action. Imagine we're implementing a game where, if you roll a 3 on a dice roll, your player doesn't move, but instead
gets a new fancy hat. If you roll a 7, your player loses a fancy hat. For all other values, your player moves that
number of spaces on the game board. Here's a <code>match</code> that implements that logic, with the result of the dice roll
hardcoded rather than a random value, and all other logic represented by functions without bodies because actually
implementing them is out of scope for this example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 =&gt; add_fancy_hat(),
        7 =&gt; remove_fancy_hat(),
        other =&gt; move_player(other),    // 1
    }
}

fn add_fancy_hat() {}
fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
fn move_player(num_spaces: u8) {}</code></pre>
<p>For the first two arms, the patterns are the literal values 3 and 7. For the last arm that covers every other possible
value, the pattern is the variable we've chosen to name <code>other</code> (1). The code that runs for the <code>other</code> arm uses the
variable by passing it to the <code>move_player</code> function.</p>
<p>This code compiles, even though we haven't listed all the possible values a <code>u8</code> can have, because the last pattern will
match all values not specifically listed. This catch-all pattern meets the requirement that <code>match</code> must be exhaustive.
Note that we have to put the catch-all arm last because the patterns are evaluated in order. If we put the catch-all arm
earlier, the other arms would never run, so Rust will warn us if we add arms after a catch-all!</p>
<p>Rust also has a pattern we can use when we want a catch-all but don't want to use the value in the catch-all
pattern: <code>_</code> is a special pattern that matches any value and does not bind to that value. This tells Rust we aren't
going to use the value, so Rust won't warn us about an unused variable.</p>
<p>Let's change the rules of the game: now, if you roll anything other than a 3 or a 7, you must roll again. We no longer
need to use the catch-all value, so we can change our code to use <code>_</code> instead of the variable named <code>other</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 =&gt; add_fancy_hat(),
        7 =&gt; remove_fancy_hat(),
        _ =&gt; reroll(),
    }
}

fn add_fancy_hat() {}
fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
fn reroll() {}</code></pre>
<p>This example also meets the exhaustiveness requirement because we're explicitly ignoring all other values in the last
arm; we haven't forgotten anything.</p>
<p>Finally, we'll change the rules of the game one more time so that nothing else happens on your turn if you roll anything
other than a 3 or a 7. We can express that by using the unit value (the empty tuple type we mentioned in &quot;The Tuple
Type&quot;) as the code that goes with the <code>_</code> arm:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let dice_roll = 9;

    match dice_roll {
        3 =&gt; add_fancy_hat(),
        7 =&gt; remove_fancy_hat(),
        _ =&gt; (),
    }
}

fn add_fancy_hat() {}
fn remove_fancy_hat() {}</code></pre>
<p>Here, we're telling Rust explicitly that we aren't going to use any other value that doesn't match a pattern in an
earlier arm, and we don't want to run any code in this case.</p>
<p>There's more about patterns and matching that we'll cover in Chapter 18. For now, we're going to move on to the <code>if let</code>
syntax, which can be useful in situations where the <code>match</code> expression is a bit wordy.</p>
<h2 id="concise-control-flow-with-if-let"><a class="header" href="#concise-control-flow-with-if-let">Concise Control Flow with if let</a></h2>
<p>The <code>if let</code> syntax lets you combine <code>if</code> and <code>let</code> into a less verbose way to handle values that match one pattern
while ignoring the rest. Consider the program in Listing 6-6 that matches on an <code>Option&lt;u8&gt;</code> value in the <code>config_max</code>
variable but only wants to execute code if the value is the <code>Some</code> variant.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    match config_max {
        Some(max) =&gt; println!(&quot;The maximum is configured to be {max}&quot;),
        _ =&gt; (),
    }
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 6-6: A <code>match</code> that only cares about executing code when the value is <code>Some</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If the value is <code>Some</code>, we print out the value in the <code>Some</code> variant by binding the value to the variable <code>max</code> in the
pattern. We don't want to do anything with the <code>None</code> value. To satisfy the <code>match</code> expression, we have to add <code>_ =&gt; ()</code>
after processing just one variant, which is annoying boilerplate code to add.</p>
<p>Instead, we could write this in a shorter way using <code>if let</code>. The following code behaves the same as the <code>match</code> in
Listng 6-6:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021">fn main() {
    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    if let Some(max) = config_max {
        println!(&quot;The maximum is configured to be {max}&quot;);
    }
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The syntax <code>if let</code> takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal sign. It works the same way as a <code>match</code>,
where the expression is given to the <code>match</code> and the pattern is its first arm. In this case, the pattern is <code>Some(max)</code>,
and the <code>max</code> binds to the value inside the <code>Some</code>. We can then use <code>max</code> in the body of the <code>if let</code> block in the same
way we used <code>max</code> in the corresponding <code>match</code> arm. The code in the <code>if let</code> block isn't run if the value doesn't match
the pattern.</p>
<p>Using <code>if let</code> means less typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate code. However you lose the exhaustive checking
that <code>match</code> enforces. Choosing between <code>match</code> and <code>if let</code> depends on what you're doing in your particular situation
and whether gaining conciseness is an appropriate trade-off for losing exhaustive checking.</p>
<p>In other words, you can think of <code>if let</code> as syntax sugar for a <code>match</code> that runs code when the value matches one
pattern and then ignores all other values.</p>
<p>We can include an <code>else</code> with an <code>if let</code>. The block of code that goes with the <code>else</code> is the same as the block of code
that would go with the <code>_</code> case in the <code>match</code> expression that is equivalent to the <code>if let</code> and <code>else</code>. Recall
the <code>Coin</code> enum definition in Listing 6-4, where the <code>Quarter</code> variant also held a <code>UsState</code> value. If we wanted to
count all non-quarter coins we see while also announcing the state of the quarters, we could do that with a <code>match</code>
expression, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    match coin {
        Coin::Quarter(state) =&gt; println!(&quot;State quarter from {:?}!&quot;, state),
        _ =&gt; count += 1,
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Or we could use an <code>if let</code> and <code>else</code> expression, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
        println!(&quot;State quarter from {:?}!&quot;, state);
    } else {
        count += 1;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>If you have a situation in which your program has logic that is too verbose to express using a <code>match</code>, remember
that <code>if let</code> is in your Rust toolbox as well.</p>
<h2 id="summary-5"><a class="header" href="#summary-5">Summary</a></h2>
<p>We've now covered how to use enums to create custom types that can be one of a set of enumerated values. We've shown how
the standard library's <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> type helps you use the type system to prevent errors. When enum values have data
inside them, you can use <code>match</code> or <code>if let</code> to extract and use those values, depending on how many cases you need to
handle.</p>
<p>Your Rust programs can now express concepts in your domain using structs and enums. Creating custom types to use in your
API ensures type safety: the compiler will make certain your functions only get values of the type each function
expects.</p>
<p>In order to provide a well-organized API to your users that is straight-forward to use and only exposes exactly what
your users will need, let's now turn to Rust's modules.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules"><a class="header" href="#managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules">Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules</a></h1>
<p>As you write large programs, organizing your code will become increasingly important. By grouping related functionality
and separating code with distinct features, you'll clarify where to find code that implements a particular feature and
where to go to change how a feature works.</p>
<p>The programs we've written so far have been in one module in one file. As a project grows, you should organize code by
splitting it into multiple modules and then multiple files. A package can contain multiple binary crates and optionally
one library crate. As a package grows, you can extract parts into separate crates that become external dependencies.
This chapter covers all these techniques. For very large projects comprising a set of inter-related packages that evolve
together, Cargo provides workspaces, which we'll cover in &quot;Cargo Workspaces&quot;.</p>
<p>We'll also discuss encapsulating implementation details, which lets you reuse code at a higher level: once you've
implemented an operation, other code can call your code via its public interface without having to know the
implementation works. The way you write code defines which parts are public for other code to use and which parts are
private implementation details that you reserve the right to change. This is another way to limit the amount of detail
you have to keep in your head.</p>
<p>A related concept is scope: the nested context in which code is written has a set of names that are defined as &quot;in
scope&quot;. When reading, writing, and compiling code, programmers and compilers need to know whether a particular name at a
particular spot refers to a variable, function, struct, enum, module, constant, or other item and what that item means.
You can create scopes and change which names are in or out of scope. You can't have two items with the same name in the
same scope; tools are available to resolve name conflicts.</p>
<p>Rust has a number of features that allow you to manage your code's organization, including which details are exposed,
which details are private, and what names are in each scope in your programs. These features, sometimes collectively
referred to as the module system, include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Packages</code>: A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates</li>
<li><code>Crates</code>: A tree of modules that produces a library or executable</li>
<li><code>Modules and use</code>: Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths</li>
<li><code>Paths</code>: A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter, we'll cover all these features, discuss how they interact, and explain how to use them to manage scope.
By the end, you should have a solid understanding of the module system and be able to work with scopes like a pro!</p>
<h2 id="packages-and-crates"><a class="header" href="#packages-and-crates">Packages and Crates</a></h2>
<p>The first parts of the module system we'll cover are packages and crates.</p>
<p>A crate is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at a time. Even if you run <code>rustc</code> rather
than <code>cargo</code> and pass a single source code file (as we did all the way back if &quot;Writing and Running a Rust Program&quot;),
the compiler considers that file to be a crate. Crates can contain modules, and the modules may be defined in other
files that get compiled with the crate, as we'll see in the coming sections.</p>
<p>A crate can come in one of two forms: a binary crate or a library crate. Binary crates are programs you can compile to
an executable that you can run, such as a command line program or a server. Each must have a function called <code>main</code> that
defines what happens when the executable runs. All the crates we've created so far have been binary crates.</p>
<p>Library crates don't have a <code>main</code> function, and they don't compile to an executable. Instead, they define functionality
intended to be shared with multiple projects. For example, the <code>rand</code> crate we used in Chapter 2 provides functionality
that generates random numbers. Most of the time when Rustaceans say &quot;crate&quot;, they mean library crate, and they use &quot;
crate&quot; inter-changeably with the general programming concept of a &quot;library&quot;.</p>
<p>The crate root is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate (we'll
explain modules in depth in &quot;Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy&quot;).</p>
<p>A package is a bundle of one or more crates that provides a set of functionality. A package contains a <code>Cargo.toml</code> file
that describes how to build those crates. Cargo is actually a package that contains the binary crate for the command
line tool you've been using to build your code. The Cargo package also contains a library crate that the binary crate
depends on. Other projects can depend on the Cargo library crate to use the same logic the Cargo command line tool uses.</p>
<p>A crate can come in one of two forms: a binary crate or a library crate. A package can contain as many binary crates as
you like, but at most only one library crate. A package must contain at least one crate, whether that's a library or
binary crate.</p>
<p>Let's walk through what happens when we create a package. First we enter the command <code>cargo new my-project</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo new my-project
     Created binary (application) `my-project` package
$ ls my-project/
Cargo.toml  src
$ ls my-project/src
main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>After we run <code>cargo new my-project</code>, we use <code>ls</code> to see what Cargo creates. In the project directory, there's
a <code>Cargo.toml</code> file, giving us a package. There's also a <code>src</code> directory that contains <code>main.rs</code>. Open <code>Cargo.toml</code> in
your text editor, and note there's no mention of <code>src/main.rs</code>. Cargo follows a convention that <code>src/main.rs</code> is the
crate root of a binary crate with the same name as the package. Likewise, Cargo knows that if the package directory
contains <code>src/lib.rs</code>, the package contains a library crate with the same name as the package, and <code>src/lib.rs</code> is its
crate root. Cargo passes the crate root files to <code>rustc</code> to build the library or binary.</p>
<p>Here, we have a package that only contains <code>src/main.rs</code>, meaning it only contains a binary crate named <code>my-project</code>. If
a package contains <code>src/main.rs</code> and <code>src/lib.rs</code>, it has two crates: a binary and a library, both with the same name as
the package. A package can have multiple binary crates by placing files in the <code>src/bin</code> directory: each file will be a
separate binary crate.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="modules-cheat-sheet"><a class="header" href="#modules-cheat-sheet">Modules cheat sheet</a></h4>
<p>Before we get to the details of modules and paths, here we provide a quick reference on how modules, paths, the use
keyword, and the <code>pub</code> keyword work in the compiler, and how most developers organize their code. We'll be going
through
examples of each of these rules throughout this chapter, but this is a great place to refer to as a reminder of how
modules work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start from the crate root</strong>: When compiling a crate, the compiler first looks in the crate root file (
&gt; usually <code>src/lib.rs</code> for a library crate or <code>src/main.rs</code> for a binary crate) for code to compile.</li>
<li><strong>Declaring modules</strong>: In the crate root file, you can declare new modules; say you declare a &quot;garden&quot; module
&gt; with <code>mod garden;</code>. The compiler will look for the module's code in these places:
&gt;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Inline, within curly brackets that replace the semicolon following <code>mod garden</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>- In the file `src/garden.rs`
- In the file `src/garden/mod.rs`
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Declaring submodules</strong>: In any file other than the crate root, you can declare submodules. For example, you might
&gt; declare <code>mod vegetables;</code> in <code>src/garden.rs</code>. The compiler will look for the submodule's code within the directory
&gt; named for the parent module in these places:
&gt;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Inline, directly following <code>mod vegatables</code>, within curly brackets instead of the semicolon</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>- In the file `src/garden/vegetables.rs`
- In the file `src/garden/vegetables/mod.rs'
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paths to code in modules</strong>: Once a module is part of your crate, you can refer to code in that module from
anywhere
&gt; else in that same crate, as long as the privacy rules allow, using the path to the code. For example,
an <code>Asparagus</code>
&gt; type in the garden vegetables module would be found at <code>crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Private vs. public</strong>: Code within a module is private from its parent modules by default. To make a module public,
&gt; declare it with <code>pub mod</code> instead of <code>mod</code>. To make items within a public module public as well, use <code>pub</code> before
&gt; their declarations.</li>
<li><strong>The <code>use</code> keyword</strong>: Within a scope, the <code>use</code> keyword creates shortcuts to items to reduce repetition of long
&gt; paths. In any scope that can refer to <code>crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus</code>, you can create a shortcut
&gt; with <code>use crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus;</code> and from then on you only need to write <code>Asparagus</code> to make use
of
&gt; that type in the scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, we create a binary crate named <code>backyard</code> that illustrates these rules. The crate's directory, also
named <code>backyard</code>, contains these files and directories:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">backyard
├───Cargo.lock
├───Cargo.toml
└───src
    ├───garden.rs
    ├───main.rs
    └───garden
        └───vegetables.rs
</code></pre>
<p>The crate root file in this case is <code>src/main.rs</code>, and it contains:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus;

pub mod garden;

fn main() {
    let plant = Asparagus {};
    println!(&quot;I'm growing {:?}!&quot;, plant);
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pub mod garden;</code> line tells the compiler to include the code it finds in <code>src/garden.rs</code>, which is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">pub mod vegetables;</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>pub mod vegetables;</code> means the code in <code>src/garden/vegetables.rs</code> is included too. That code is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Asparagus {}</code></pre>
<p>Now let's get into the details of these rules and demonstrate them in action!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy"><a class="header" href="#defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy">Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy</a></h2>
<p>In this section, we'll talk about modules and other parts of the module system, namely paths, which allow you to name
items; the <code>use</code> keyword that brings a path into scope; and the <code>pub</code> keyword to make items public. We'll also discuss
the <code>as</code> keyword, external packages, and the glob operator.</p>
<p>Modules let us organize code within a crate for readability and easy reuse. Modules also allow us to control the privacy
of items because code within a module is private by default. Private items are internal implementation details not
available for outside use. We can choose to make modules and the items within them public, which exposes them to allow
external code to use and depend on them.</p>
<p>As an example, let's write a library crate that provides the functionality of a restaurant. We'll define the signatures
of functions but leave their bodies empty to concentrate on the organization of the code rather than the implementation
of a restaurant.</p>
<p>In the restaurant industry, some parts of a restaurant are referred to as front of house and others as back of house.
Front of house is where customers are; this encompasses where the hosts seat customers, servers take orders and payment,
and bartenders make drinks. Back of house is where the chefs and cooks work in the kitchen, dishwashers clean up, and
managers do administrative work.</p>
<p>To structure our crate in this way, we can organize its functions into nested modules. Create a new library
named <code>restaurant</code> by running <code>cargo new restaurant --lib</code>. Then enter the code in Listing 7-1 into <code>src/lib.rs</code> to
define some modules and function signatures; this code is the front of house section.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}
        
        fn seat_at_table() {}
    }
    
    mod serving {
        fn take_order() {}
        
        fn serve_order() {}
        
        fn take_payment() {}
    }
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-1: A <code>front_of_house</code> module containing other modules that then contain functions</li>
</ul>
<p>We define a module with the <code>mod</code> keyword followed by the name of the module (in this case, <code>front_of_house</code>). The body
of the module then goes inside curly brackets. Inside modules, we can place other modules, as in this case with the
modules <code>hosting</code> and <code>serving</code>. Modules can also hold definitions for other items, such as structs, enums, constants,
traits, and as in Listing 7-1, functions.</p>
<p>By using modules, we can group related definitions together and name why they're related. Programmers using this code
can navigate the code based on the groups rather than having to read through all the definitions, making it easier to
find the definitions relevant to them. Programmers adding new functionality to this code would know where to place the
code to keep the program organized.</p>
<p>Earlier, we mentioned that <code>src/main.rs</code> and <code>src/lib.rs</code> are called crate roots. The reason for their name is that the
contents of either of these two files from a module named <code>crate</code> at the root of the crate's module structure, known as
the module tree.</p>
<p>Listing 7-2 shows the module tree for the structure in Listing 7-1.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">crate
└── front_of_house
    ├── hosting
    │   ├── add_to_waitlist
    │   └── seat_at_table
    └── serving
        ├── take_order
        ├── serve_order
        └── take_payment
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-2: The module tree for the code in Listing 7-1</li>
</ul>
<p>This tree shows how some of the modules nest inside other modules; for example, <code>hosting</code> nests inside <code>front_of_house</code>.
The tree also shows that some modules are siblings, meaning they're defined in the same module; <code>hosting</code> and <code>serving</code>
are siblings defined within <code>front_of_hose</code>. If module A is contained inside module B, we say that module A is the child
of module B and that module B is the parent of module A. Notice that the entire module tree is rooted under the implicit
module named <code>crate</code>.</p>
<p>The module tree might remind you of the filesystem's directory tree on your computer; this is a very apt comparison!
Just like directories in a filesystem, you use modules to organize your code. And just like files in a directory, we
need a way to find our modules.</p>
<h2 id="paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree"><a class="header" href="#paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree">Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree</a></h2>
<p>To show Rust where to find an item in a module tree, we use a path in the same way we use a path when navigating a
filesystem. To call a function, we need to know its path.</p>
<p>A path can take two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>An absolute path is the full path starting from a crate root; for code from an external crate, the absolute path
begins with the crate name, and for code from the current crate, it starts with the literal <code>crate</code>.</li>
<li>A relative path starts from the current module and uses <code>self</code>, <code>super</code>, or an identifier in the current module.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both absolute and relative paths are followed by one or more identifiers separated by double colons (<code>::</code>).</p>
<p>Returning to Listing 7-1, say we want to call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function. This is the same as asking: what's the
path of the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function? Listing 7-3 contains Listing 7-1 with some of the modules and functions removed.</p>
<p>We'll show two ways to call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function from a new function, <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, defined in the
crate root. These paths are correct, but there's another problem remaining that will prevent this example from compiling
as is. We'll explain why in a bit.</p>
<p>The <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function is part of our library crate's public API, so we mark it with the <code>pub</code> keyword. In &quot;
Exposing Paths with the pub Keyword&quot;, we'll go into more detail about <code>pub</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    
    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-3: Calling the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function using absolute and relative paths</li>
</ul>
<p>The first time we call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, we use an absolute path.
The <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function is defined in the same crate as <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, which means we can use the <code>crate</code>
keyword to start an absolute path. We then include each of the successive modules until we make our way
to <code>add_to_waitlist</code>. You can imagine a filesystem with the same structure: we'd specify the
path <code>/front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist</code> to run the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> program; using the <code>crate</code> name to start
from the crate root is like using <code>/</code> to start from the filesystem root in your shell.</p>
<p>The second time we call <code>add_to_waitlist</code> in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, we use a relative path. The path starts
with <code>front_of_house</code>, the name of the module defined at the same level of the module tree as <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>. Here
the filesystem equivalent would be using the path <code>front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlitst</code>. Starting with a module name
means that the path is relative.</p>
<p>Choosing whether to use a relative or absolute path is a decision you'll make based on your project, and it depends on
whether you're more likely to move item definition code separately from of together with the code that uses the item.
For example, if we moved the <code>front_of_house</code> module and the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function into a module
named <code>customer_experience</code>, we'd need to update the absolute path to <code>add_to_waitlist</code>, but the relative path would
still be valid. However, if we moved the <code>eat_at_resturant</code> function separately into a module named <code>dining</code>, the
absolute path to the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> call would stay the same, but the relative path would need to be updated. Our
preference in general is to specify absolute paths because it's more likely we'll want to move code definitions and item
calls independently of each other.</p>
<p>Let's try to compile Listing 7-3 and find out why it won't compile yet! The errors we get are shown in Listing 7-4.</p>

<ul>
<li>Listing 7-4: Compiler errors from building the code in Listing 7-3.</li>
</ul>
<p>The error messages say that module <code>hosting</code> is private. In other words, we have the correct paths for the <code>hosting</code>
module and the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function, but Rust won't let us use them because it doesn't have access to the private
sections. In Rust, all items (functions, methods, structs, enums, modules, and constants) are private to parent modules
by default. If you want to make an item like a function or struct private, you put it in a module.</p>
<p>Items in a parent module can't use the private items inside child modules, but items in child modules can use the items
in their ancestor modules. This is because child modules wrap and hide their implementation details, but the child
modules an see the context in which they're defined. To continue with our metaphor, think of the privacy rules as being
like the back office of a restaurant: what goes on in there is private to restaurant customers, but office managers can
see and do everything in the restaurant they operate.</p>
<p>Rust chose to have the module system function this way so that hiding inner implementation details is the default. That
way, you know which parts of the inner code you can change without breaking outer code. However, Rust does give you the
option to expose inner parts of child module's code to outer ancestor modules by using the <code>pub</code> keyword to make an item
public.</p>

<li>Listing 7-6: Compiler errors from building the code in Listing 7-5</li>
</ul>
<p>What happened? Adding the <code>pub</code> keyword in front of <code>mod hosting</code> make the module public. With this change, if we can
access <code>front_of_house</code>, we can access <code>hosting</code>. But the contents of <code>hosting</code> are still private; making the module
public doesn't make its contents public. The <code>pub</code> keyword on a module only lets code in its ancestor modules refer to
it, not access its inner code. Because modules are containers, there's not much we can do by only making the module
public; we need to go further and choose to make one or more of the items within the module public as well.</p>
<p>The errors in Listing 7-6 says that the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function is private. The privacy rules apply to structs,
enums, functions, and methods as well as modules.</p>
<p>Let's also make the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function public by adding the <code>pub</code> keyword before its definition, as in Listing
7-7.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    
    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-7: Adding the <code>pub</code> keyword to <code>mod hosting</code> and <code>fn add_to_waitlitst</code> lets us call the function
from <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the code will compile! To see why adding the <code>pub</code> keyword lets us use these paths in <code>add_to_waitlist</code> with respect
to the privacy rules, let's look at the absolute and the relative paths.</p>
<p>In the absolute path, we start with <code>crate</code>, the root of our crate's module tree. The <code>front_of_house</code> module is defined
in the crate root. While <code>front_of_house</code> isn't public, because the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function is defined in the same
module as <code>front_of_house</code> (that is, <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> and <code>front_of_house</code> are siblings), we can refer
to <code>front_of_house</code> from <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>. Next is the <code>hosting</code> module marked with <code>pub</code>. We can access the parent
module of <code>hosting</code>, so we can access <code>hosting</code>. Finally, the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function is marked with <code>pub</code> and we can
access its parent module, so this function call works!</p>
<p>In the relative path, the logic is the same as the absolute path except for the first step: rather than starting from
the crate root, the path starts from <code>front_of_house</code>. The <code>front_of_house</code> module is defined within the same module
as <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, so the relative path starting from the module in which <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> is defined works.
Then, because <code>hosting</code> and <code>add_to_waitlist</code> are marked with <code>pub</code>, the rest of the path works, and this function call
is valid!</p>
<p>If you plan on sharing your library crate so other projects can use your code, your public API is your contract with
users of your crate that determines how they can interact with your code. There are many considerations around managing
changes to your public API to make it easier for people to depend on your crate. These considerations are beyond the
scope of this book; if you're interested in this topic, see the Rust API Guidelines
at https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines.</p>

<h4 id="best-practices-for-packages-with-a-binary-and-a-library"><a class="header" href="#best-practices-for-packages-with-a-binary-and-a-library">Best Practices for Packages with a Binary and a Library</a></h4>
<p>We mentioned that a package can contain both a <code>src/main.rs</code> binary crate root as well as a src/lib.rs` library crate
root, and both crates will have the package name by default. Typically, packages with this pattern of containing both
a
library and a binary crate will have just enough code in the binary crate to start an executable that calls code with
the library crate. This lets other projects benefit from the most functionality that the package provides because the
library crate's code can be shared.</p>
<p>The module tree should be defined in <code>src/lib.rs</code>. Then any public items can be used in the binary crate by starting
paths with the name of the package. The binary crate becomes a user of the library crate just like a completely
external
crate would use the library crate: it can only use the public API. This helps you design a good API; not only are you
the author, you're also a client!</p>
<p>In Chapter 12, we'll demonstrate this organizational practice with a command line program that will contain both a
binary crate and a library crate.</p>

<h3 id="starting-relative-paths-with-super"><a class="header" href="#starting-relative-paths-with-super">Starting Relative Paths with super</a></h3>
<p>We can construct relative paths that begin in the parent module, rather than the current module or the crate root, by
using <code>super</code> at the start of the path. This is like starting a filesystem path with the <code>..</code> syntax. Using <code>super</code>
allows us to reference an item that we know is in the parent module, which can make rearranging the module tree easier
when the module is closely related to the parent but the parent might be moved elsewhere in the module tree someday.</p>
<p>Consider the code in Listing 7-8 that models the situation in which a chef fixes an incorrect order and personally
brings it out to the customer. The function <code>fix_incorrect_order</code> defined in the <code>back_of_house</code> module calls the
function <code>deliver_order</code> defined in the parent module by specifying the path to <code>deliver_order</code>, starting with <code>super</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn deliver_order() {}

mod back_of_house {
    fn fix_incorrect_order() {
        cook_order();
        super::deliver_order();
    }

    fn cook_order() {}
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-8: Calling a function using a relative path starting with <code>super</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>fix_incorrect_order</code> function is in the <code>back_of_house</code> module, so we can use <code>super</code> to go to the parent module
of <code>back_of_house</code>, which in this case is <code>crate</code>, the root. From there, we look for <code>deliver_order</code> and find it.
Success! We think the <code>back_of_house</code> module and the <code>deliver_order</code> function are likely to stay in the same
relationship to each other and get moved together should we decide to reorganize the crate's module tree. Therefore, we
used <code>super</code> so we'll have fewer places to update code in the future if this code gets moved to a different module.</p>
<h3 id="making-structs-and-enums-public"><a class="header" href="#making-structs-and-enums-public">Making Structs and Enums Public</a></h3>
<p>We can also use <code>pub</code> to designate structs and enums as public, but there are a few extra details to the usage of <code>pub</code>
with structs and enums. If we use <code>pub</code> before a struct definition, we make the struct public, but the struct's fields
will still be private. We can make each field public or not on a case-by-case basis. In Listing 7-9, we've defined a
public <code>back_of_house::Breakfast</code> struct with a public <code>toast</code> field but a private <code>seasonal_fruit</code> field. This models
the case in a restaurant where the customer can pick the type of bread that comes with a meal, but the chef decides
which fruit accompanies the meal based on what's in season and in stock. The available fruit changes quickly, so
customers can't choose the fruit or even see which fruit they'll get.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">mod back_of_house {
    pub struct Breakfast {
        pub toast: String,
        seasonal_fruit: String,
    }

    impl Breakfast {
        pub fn summer(toast: &amp;str) -&gt; Breakfast {
            Breakfast {
                toast: String::from(toast),
                seasonal_fruit: String::from(&quot;peaches&quot;),
            }
        }
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Order a breakfast in the summer with Rye toast.
    let mut meal = back_of_house::Breakfast::summer(&quot;Rye&quot;);

    // Change our mind about what bread we'd like.
    meal.toast = String::from(&quot;Wheat&quot;);
    println!(&quot;I'd like {} toast please&quot;, meal.toast);

    // The next line won't compile if we uncomment it; we're not allowed to see or modify
    // the seasonal fruit that comes with the meal.
    // meal.seasonal_fruit = String::from(&quot;blueberries&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-9: A struct with some public fields and some private fields</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the <code>toast</code> field in the <code>back_of_house::Breakfast</code> struct is public, in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> we can write and
read to the <code>toast</code> field using dot notation. Notice that we can't use the <code>seasonal_fruit</code> field
in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, because <code>seasonal_fruit</code> is private. Try uncommenting the line modifying the <code>seasonal_fruit</code>
field value to see what error you get!</p>
<p>Also, note that because <code>back_of_house::Breakfast</code> has a private field, the struct needs to provide a public associated
function that constructs an instance of <code>Breakfast</code> (we've named it <code>summer</code> here). If <code>Breakfast</code> didn't have such a
function, we couldn't set the value of the private <code>seasonal_fruit</code> field in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>.</p>
<p>In contrast, if we make an enum public, all of its variants are then public. We only need the <code>pub</code> before the <code>enum</code>
keyword, as shown in Listing 7-10.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">mod back_of_house {
    pub enum Appetizer {
        Soup,
        Salad,
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    let order1 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Soup;
    let order2 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Salad;
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-10: Designating an enum as public makes all its variants public.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because we made the <code>Appetizer</code> enum public, we can use the <code>Soup</code> and <code>Salad</code> variants in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>.</p>
<p>Enums aren't very useful unless their variants are public; it would be annoying to have to annotate all enum variants
with <code>pub</code> in every case, so the default for enum variants is to be public. Structs are often useful without their
fields being public, so struct fields follow the general rule of everything being private by default unless annotated
with <code>pub</code>.</p>
<p>There's one more situation involving <code>pub</code> that we haven't covered, and that is our last module system feature:
the <code>use</code> keyword. We'll cover <code>use</code> by itself first, and then we'll show how to combine <code>pub</code> and <code>use</code>.</p>
<h2 id="bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword"><a class="header" href="#bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword">Bringing Paths into Scope with the use Keyword</a></h2>
<p>Having to write out the paths to call functions can feel inconvenient and repetitive. In Listing 7-7, whether we chose
the absolute or relative path to the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function, every time we wanted to call <code>add_to_waitlist</code> we had
to specify <code>front_of_house</code> and <code>hosting</code> too. Fortunately, there's a way to simplify this process: we can create a
shortcut to a path with the <code>use</code> keyword once, and then use the shorter name everywhere else in the scope.</p>
<p>In Listing 7-11, we bring the <code>crate::front_of_house::hosting</code> module into the scope of the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function
so we only have to specify <code>hosting::add_to_waitlist</code> to call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-11: Bringing a module into scope with use</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding <code>use</code> and a path in a scope is similar to creating a symbolic link in the filesystem. By
adding <code>use crate::front_of_house::hosting</code> in the crate root, <code>hosting</code> is now a valid name in that scope, just as
though the <code>hosting</code> module had been defined in the crate root. Paths brought into scope with <code>use</code> also check privacy,
like any other paths.</p>
<p>Note that <code>use</code> only creates the shortcut for the particular scope in which the <code>use</code> occurs. Listing 7-12 moves
the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function into a new child module named <code>customer</code>, which is then a different scope that
the <code>use</code> statement, so the function body won't compile.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

mod customer {
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-12: A <code>use</code> statement only applies in the scope it's in.</li>
</ul>
<p>The compiler error shows that the shortcut no longer applies within the <code>custoner</code> module:</p>

<h3 id="creating-idiomatic-use-paths"><a class="header" href="#creating-idiomatic-use-paths">Creating Idiomatic use Paths</a></h3>
<p>In Listing 7-11, you might have wondered why we specified <code>use crate::front_of_house::hosting</code> and then
called <code>hosting::add_to_waitlist</code> in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, rather than specifying the <code>use</code> path all the way out to
the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function to achieve the same result, as in Listing 7-13.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    add_to_waitlist();
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-13: Bringing the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function into scope with <code>use</code>, which is unidiomatic</li>
</ul>
<p>Although both Listing 7-11 and Listing 7-13 accomplish the same task, Listing 7-11 is the idiomatic way to bring a
function into scope with <code>use</code>. Bringing the function's parent module into scope with <code>use</code> means we have to specify the
parent module when calling the function. Specifying the parent module when calling the function. Specifying the parent
module when calling the function makes it clear that the function isn't locally defined while still minimizing
repetition of the full path. The code in Listing 7-13 is unclear as to where <code>add_to_waitlist</code> is defined.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when bringing in structs, enums, and other items with <code>use</code>, it's idiomatic to specify the full path.
Listing 7-13 shows the idiomatic way to bring the standard library's <code>HashMap</code> struct into the scope of binary crate.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert(1, 2);
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-14: Bringing <code>HashMap</code> into scope in an idiomatic way</li>
</ul>
<p>There's no strong reason behind this idiom: it's just the convention that has emerged, and folks have gotten used to
reading and writing Rust code this way.</p>
<p>The exception to this idiom is if we're bringing two items with the same name into scope with <code>use</code> statements, because
Rust doesn't allow that. Listing 7-15 shows how to bring two <code>Result</code> types into scope that have the same name but
different parent modules, and how to refer to them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::fmt;
use std::io;

fn function1() -&gt; fmt::Result {
    // snip
}

fn function2() -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {
    // snip
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-15: Bringing two types with the same name into the same scope requires using their parent modules.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, using the parent modules distinguishes the two <code>Result</code> types. If instead we
specified <code>use std::fmt::Result</code> and <code>use std::io::Result</code>, we'd have two <code>Result</code> types in the same scope, and Rust
wouldn't know which one we meant when we used <code>Result</code>.</p>
<h3 id="providing-new-names-with-the-as-keyword"><a class="header" href="#providing-new-names-with-the-as-keyword">Providing New Names with the as Keyword</a></h3>
<p>There's another solution to the problem of bringing two types of the same name into the same scope with <code>use</code>: after the
path, we can specify <code>as</code> and a new local name, or alias, for the type. Listing 7-16 shows another way to write the code
in Listing 7-15 by renaming one of the two <code>Result</code> types using <code>as</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::fmt::Result;
use std::io::Result as IoResult;

fn function1() -&gt; Result {
    // snip
}

fn function2() -&gt; IoResult&lt;()&gt; {
    // snip
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-16: Renaming a type when it's brought into scope with the <code>as</code> keyword</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second <code>use</code> statement, we chose the new name <code>IoResult</code> for the <code>std::io:Result</code> type, which won't conflict with
the <code>Result</code> from <code>std::fmt</code> that we've also brought into scope. Listing 7-15 and Listing 7-16 are considered idiomatic,
so the choice is up to you!</p>
<h3 id="re-exporting-names-with-pub-use"><a class="header" href="#re-exporting-names-with-pub-use">Re-exporting Names with pub use</a></h3>
<p>When we bring a name into scope with the <code>use</code> keyword, the name available in the new scope is private. To enable the
code that calls our code to refer to that name as if it had been defined in that code's scope, we can combine <code>pub</code>
and <code>use</code>. This technique is called re-exporting because we're bringing an item into scope but also making that item
available for others to bring into their scope.</p>
<p>Listing 7-17 shows the code in Listing 7-11 with <code>use</code> in the root module changed to <code>pub use</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-17: Making a name available for any code to use from a new scope with <code>pub use</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Before this change, external code would have to call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function by using the
path <code>restaurant::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist()</code>. Now that this <code>pub use</code> has re-exported the <code>hosting</code>
module from the root module, external code can use the path <code>restaurant::hosting::add_to_waitlist()</code> instead.</p>
<p>Re-exporting is useful when the internal structure of your code is different from how programmers calling your code
would think about the domain. For example, in this restaurant metaphor, the people running the restaurant think about &quot;
front of house&quot; and &quot;back of house&quot;. But customers visiting a restaurant probably won't think about the parts of the
restaurant in those terms. With <code>pub use</code>, we can write our code with one structure but expose a different structure.
Doing so makes our library well organized for programmers working on the library and programmers calling the library.
We'll look at another example of <code>pub use</code> and how it affects your crate's documentation in &quot;Exporting a Convenient
Public API with pub use&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="using-external-packages"><a class="header" href="#using-external-packages">Using External Packages</a></h3>
<p>In Chapter 2, we programmed a guessing game project that used an external package called <code>rand</code> to get random numbers.
To use <code>rand</code> in our project, we added this line to <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">rand = &quot;0.8.5&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Adding <code>rand</code> as a dependency in <code>Cargo.toml</code> tells Cargo to download the <code>rand</code> package and any dependencies
from <code>https://crates.io</code>, and make <code>rand</code> available to our project.</p>
<p>Then, to bring <code>rand</code> definitions into the scope of our package, we added a <code>use</code> line starting with the name of the
crate, <code>rand</code>, and listed the items we wanted to bring into scope. Recall that in &quot;Generating a Random Number&quot;, we
brough the <code>Rng</code> trait into scope and called the <code>rand::thread_rng</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
}</code></pre>
<p>Members of the Rust community have made many packages available at <code>https://crates.io</code>, and pulling any of them into
your package involves these same steps: listing them in your package's <code>Cargo.toml</code> file and using <code>use</code> to bring items
from their crates into scope.</p>
<p>Note that the standard <code>std</code> library is also a crate that's external to our package. Because the standard library is
shipped with the Rust language, we don't need to change <code>Cargo.toml</code> to include <code>std</code>. But we do need to refer to it
with <code>use</code> to bring items from there into our package's scope. For example, with <code>HashMap</code> we would use this line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::collections::HashMap;</code></pre>
<p>This is an absolute path starting with <code>std</code>, the name of the standard library crate.</p>
<h3 id="using-nested-paths-to-clean-up-large-use-lists"><a class="header" href="#using-nested-paths-to-clean-up-large-use-lists">Using Nested Paths to Clean Up Large use Lists</a></h3>
<p>If we're using multiple items defined in the same crate or same module, listing each item on its own line can take up a
lot of vertical space in our files. For example, these two <code>use</code> statements we had in the guessing game in Listing 2-4
bring items from <code>std</code> into scope:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">// snip
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;
// snip</code></pre>
<p>Instead, we can use nested paths to bring the same items into scope in one line. We do this by specifying the common
part of the path, followed by two colons, and then curly brackets around a list of the parts of the paths that differ,
as showin in Listing 7-18.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">// snip
use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};
// snip</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-18: Specifying a nested path to bring multiple items with the same prefix into scope</li>
</ul>
<p>In bigger programs, bringing many items into scope from the same crate or module using nested paths can reduce the
number of separate <code>use</code> statements needed by a lot!</p>
<p>We can use a nested path at any level in a path, which is useful when combining two <code>use</code> statements that share a
subpath. For example, Listing 7-19 shows two <code>use</code> statements: one that brings <code>std::io</code> into scope and one that
brings <code>std::io::Write</code> into scope.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::io;
use std::io::Write;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-19: Two <code>use</code> statements where one is a subpath of the other</li>
</ul>
<p>The common part of these two paths is <code>std::io</code>, and that's the complete first path. To merge these two paths into
one <code>use</code> statement, we can use <code>self</code> in the nested path, as shown in Listing 7-20.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::io::{self, Write};</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-20: Combining the paths in Listing 7-19 into one <code>use</code> statement</li>
</ul>
<p>This line brings <code>std::io</code> and <code>std::io::Write</code> into scope.</p>
<h3 id="the-glob-operator"><a class="header" href="#the-glob-operator">The Glob Operator</a></h3>
<p>If we want to bring all public items defined in a path into scope, we can specify that path followed by the <code>*</code> glob
operator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::collections::*;</code></pre>
<p>This <code>use</code> statement brings all public items defined in <code>std::collections</code> into the current scope. Be careful when using
the glob operator! Glob can make it harder to tell what names are in scope and where a name used in your program was
defined.</p>
<p>The glob operator is often used when testing to bring everything under test into the <code>test</code> module; we'll talk about
that in &quot;How to Write Tests&quot;. The glob operator is also sometimes used as part of the prelude pattern: see the standard
library documentation for more information on that pattern.</p>
<h2 id="separating-modules-into-different-files"><a class="header" href="#separating-modules-into-different-files">Separating Modules into Different Files</a></h2>
<p>So far, all the examples in this chapter defined multiple modules in one file. When modules get large, you might want to
move their definitions to a separate file to make the code easier to navigate.</p>
<p>For example, let's start from the code in Listing 7-17 that had multiple restaurant modules. We'll extract modules into
files instead of having all the modules defined in the crate root file. In this case, the crate root file
is <code>src/lib.rs</code>, but this procedure also works with binary crates whose crate root file is <code>src/main.rs</code>.</p>
<p>First we'll extract the <code>front_of_house</code> module to its own file. Remove the code inside the curly brackets for
the <code>front_of_house</code> module, leaving only the <code>mod front_of_house;</code> declaration, so that <code>src/lib.rs</code> contains the code
shown in Listing 7-21. Note that this won't compile until we create the <code>src/front_of_house.rs</code> file in Listing 7-22.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">mod front_of_house;

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-21: Declaring the <code>front_of_house</code> module whose body will be in <code>src/front_of_house.rs</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Next, place the code that was in the curly brackets into a new file named <code>src/front_of_house.rs</code>, as shown in Listing
7-22. The compiler knows to look in this file because it came across the module declaration in the crate root with the
name <code>front_of_house</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">pub mod hosting {
    pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 7-22: Definitions inside the <code>front_of_house</code> module in <code>src/front_of_house.rs</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you only need to load a file using a <code>mod</code> declaration once in your module tree. Once the compiler knows the
file is part of the project (and knows where in the module tree the code resides because of where you've put the <code>mod</code>
statement), other files in your project should refer to the loaded file's code using a path to where it was declared, as
covered in &quot;Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree&quot;. In other words, <code>mod</code> is not an &quot;include&quot; operation that
you may have seen in other programming languages.</p>
<p>Next, we'll extract the <code>hosting</code> module to its own file. The process is a bit different because <code>hosting</code> is a child
module of <code>front_of_house</code>, not of the root module. We'll place the file for <code>hosting</code> in a new directory that will be
named for its ancestors in the module tree, in this case <code>src/front_of_house</code>.</p>
<p>To start moving <code>hosting</code>, we change <code>src/front_of_house.rs</code> to contain only the declaration of the <code>hosting</code> module:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">pub mod hosting;</code></pre>
<p>Then we create a <code>src/front_of_house</code> directory and a <code>hosting.rs</code> file to contain the definitions made in the <code>hosting</code>
module:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}</code></pre>
<p>If we instead put <code>hosting.rs</code> in the <code>src</code> directory, the compiler would expect the <code>hosting.rs</code> code to be in
a <code>hosting</code> module declared in the crate root, and not declared as a child of the <code>front_of_house</code> module. The
compiler's rules for which files to check for which modules' code mean the directories and files more closely match the
module tree.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="alternate-file-paths"><a class="header" href="#alternate-file-paths">Alternate file paths</a></h4>
<p>So far we've covered the most idiomatic file paths the Rust compiler uses, but Rust also supports an older type of
file
path. For a module named <code>front_of_house</code> declared in the crate root, the compiler will look for the module's code in:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>src/front_of_house.rs</code> (what we covered)</li>
<li><code>src/front_of_house/mod.rs</code> (older stype, still supported path)</li>
</ul>
<p>For a module named <code>hosting</code> that is a submodule of <code>front_of_house</code>, the compiler will look for the module's code in:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>src/front_of_house/hosting.rs</code> (what we covered)</li>
<li><code>src/front_of_house/hosting/mod.rs</code> (older stype, still supported path)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use both styles for the same module, you'll get a compiler error. Using a mix of both styles for different
modules in the same project is allowed, but might be confusing for people navigating your project.</p>
<p>The main downside to the style that uses files named <code>mod.rs</code> is that your project can end up with many files
named <code>mod.rs</code>, which can get confusing when you have them open in your editor at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We've moved each module's code to a separate file, and the module tree remains the same. The function calls
in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> will work without any modification, even though the definitions live in different files. This
technique lets you move modules to new files as they grow in size.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting</code> statement in <code>src/lib.rs</code> also hasn't changed, nor does <code>use</code>
have any impact on what files are compiled as part of the crate. The <code>mode</code> keyword declares modules, and Rust looks in
a file with the same name as the module for the code that goes into that module.</p>
<h2 id="summary-6"><a class="header" href="#summary-6">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Rust lets you split a package into multiple crates and a crate into modules so you can refer to items defined in one
module from another module. You can do this by specifying absolute or relative paths. These paths can be brought into
scope with a <code>use</code> statement so you can use a shorter path for multiple uses of the item in that scope. Module code is
private by default, but you can make definitions public by adding the <code>pub</code> keyword.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we'll look at some collection data structures in the standard library that you can use in your
neatly organized code.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="common-collections"><a class="header" href="#common-collections">Common Collections</a></h1>
<p>Rust's standard library includes a number of very useful data structures called collections. Most other data types
represent one specific value, but collections can contain multiple values. Unlike the built-in array and tuple types,
the data that these collections point to is stored on the heap, which means the amount of data does not need to be known
at compile time and can grow or shrink as the program runs. Each kind of collection has different capabilities and
costs, and choosing an appropriate one for your current situation is a skill you'll develop over time. In this chapter,
we'll discuss three collections that are used very often in Rust programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>A vector allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.</li>
<li>A string is a collection of characters. We've mentioned the <code>String</code> type previously, but in this chapter we'll talk
about it in depth.</li>
<li>A hash map allows you to associate a value with a specific key. It's a particular implementation of the more general
data structure called a map.</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn about the other kinds of collections provided by the standard library, see the documentation
at https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/index.html.</p>
<p>We'll discuss how to create and update vectors, strings, and hash maps, as well as what makes each special.</p>
<h2 id="storing-lists-of-values-with-vectors"><a class="header" href="#storing-lists-of-values-with-vectors">Storing Lists of Values with Vectors</a></h2>
<p>The first collection type we'll look at is <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, also known as a vector. Vectors allow you to store more than one
value in a single data structure that puts all the values next to each other in memory. Vectors can only store values of
the same type. They are useful when you have a list of items, such as the lines of text in a file or the prices of items
in a shopping cart.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-new-vector"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-new-vector">Creating a New Vector</a></h3>
<p>To create a new empty vector, we call the <code>Vec::new</code> function, as shown in Listing 8-1.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let v: Vec&lt;i32&gt; = Vec::new();</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 8-1: Creating a new, empty vector to hold values of type <code>i32</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we added a type annotation here. Because we aren't inserting any values into this vector, Rust doesn't know
what kind of elements we intend to store. This is an important point. Vectors are implemented using generics; we'll
cover how to use generics with your own types in Chapter 10. For now, know that the <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> type provided by the
standard library can hold any type. When we create a vector to hold a specific type, we can specify the type within
angle brackets. In Listing 8-1, we've told Rust that the <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> in <code>v</code> will hold elements of the <code>i32</code> type.</p>
<p>More often, you'll create a <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> with initial values and Rust will infer the type of value you want to store, so you
rarely need to do this type annotation. Rust conveniently provides the <code>vec!</code> macro, which will create a new vector that
holds the values you give it. Listing 8-2 creates a new <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> that holds the values <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>. The integer
type is <code>i32</code> because that's the default integer type, as we discussed in &quot;Data Types&quot;.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let v = vec![1, 2, 3];</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 8-2: Creating a new vector containing values</li>
</ul>
<p>Because we've given initial <code>i32</code> values, Rust can infer that the type of <code>v</code> is <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code>, and the type annotation
isn't necessary. Next, we'll look at how to modify a vector.</p>
<h3 id="updating-a-vector"><a class="header" href="#updating-a-vector">Updating a Vector</a></h3>
<p>To create a vector and then add elements to it, we can use the <code>push</code> method, as shown in Listing 8-3.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let mut v = Vec::new();

v.push(5);
v.push(6);
v.push(7);
v.push(8);</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 8-3: Using the <code>push</code> method to add values to a vector</li>
</ul>
<p>As with any variable, if we want to be able to change its value, we need to make it mutable using the <code>mut</code> keyword, as
discussed in Chapter 3. The numbers we place inside are all of type <code>i32</code>, and Rust infers this from the data, so we
don't need the <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> annotation.</p>
<h3 id="reading-elements-of-vectors"><a class="header" href="#reading-elements-of-vectors">Reading Elements of Vectors</a></h3>
<p>There are two ways to reference a value stored in a vector: via indexing or by using the <code>get</code> method. In the following
examples, we've annotated the types of the values that are returned from these functions for extra clarity.</p>
<p>Listing 8-4 shows both methods of accessing a value in a vector, with indexing syntax and the <code>get</code> method.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let third: &amp;i32 = &amp;v[2];    // (1)
    println!(&quot;The third element is {third}&quot;);

    let third: Option&lt;&amp;i32&gt; = v.get(2);     // (2)
    match third {
        Some(third) =&gt; println!(&quot;The third element is {third}&quot;),
        None =&gt; println!(&quot;There is no third element.&quot;),
    }
}</code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 8-4: Using indexing syntax and using the <code>get</code> method to access an item in a vector</li>
</ul>
<p>Note a few details here. We use the index value of <code>2</code> to get the third element (1) because vectors are indexed by
number, starting at zero. Using <code>&amp;</code> and <code>[]</code> gives us a reference to the element at the index value. When we use
the <code>get</code> method with the index passed as an argument (2), we get an <code>Option&lt;&amp;T&gt;</code> that we can use with <code>match</code>.</p>
<p>Rust provides these two ways to reference an element so you can choose how the program behaves when you try to use an
index value outside the range of existing elements. As an example, let's see what happens when we have a vector of five
elements and then we try to access an element at index 100 with each technique, as shown in Listing 8-5.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
    let does_not_exist = &amp;v[100];
    let does_not_exist = v.get(100);
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 8-5: Attempting to access the element at index 100 in a vector containing five elements</li>
</ul>
<p>When we run this code, the first <code>[]</code> method will cause the program to panic because it references a nonexistent
element. This method is best used when you want your program to crash if there's an attempt to access an element past
the end of the vector.</p>
<p>When the <code>get</code> method is passed an index that is outside the vector, it returns <code>None</code> without panicking. You would use
this method if accessing an element beyond the range of the vector may happen occasionally under normal circumstances.
Your code will then have logic to handle having either <code>Some(&amp;element)</code> or <code>None</code>, as discussed in Chapter 6. For
example, the index could be coming from a person entering a number. If they accidentally enter a number that's too large
and the program gets a <code>None</code> value, you could tell the user how many items are in the current vector and give them
another chance to enter a valid value. That would be more user-friendly than crashing the program due to a typo!</p>
<p>When the program has a valid reference, the borrow checker enforces the ownership and borrowing rules (covered in
Chapter 4) to ensure this reference and any other references to the contents of the vector remain valid. Recall the rule
that states you can't have mutable and immutable references in the same scope. That rule applies in Listing 8-6, where
we hold an immutable reference to the first element in a vector and try to add an element to the end. This program won't
work if we also try to refer to that element later in the function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = &amp;v[0];

    v.push(6);

    println!(&quot;The first element is: {first}&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 8-6: Attempting to add an element to a vector while holding a reference to an item</li>
</ul>
<p>Compiling this code will result in this error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0502]: cannot borrow `v` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 --&gt; src\main.rs:6:5
  |
4 |     let first = &amp;v[0];
  |                  - immutable borrow occurs here
5 |
6 |     v.push(6);
  |     ^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
7 |
8 |     println!(&quot;The first element is: {first}&quot;);
  |                                      ----- immutable borrow later used here
</code></pre>
<p>The code in Listing 8-6 might look like it should work: why should a reference to the first element care about changes
at the end of the vector? This error is due to the way vectors work: because vectors put the values next to each other
in memory, adding a new element onto the end of the vector might require allocating new memory and copying the old
elements to the new space, if there isn't enough room to put all the elements next to each other where the vector is
currently stored. In that case, the reference to the first element would be pointing to deallocated memory. The
borrowing rules prevent programs from ending up in that situation.</p>

<h3 id="iterating-over-the-values-in-a-vector"><a class="header" href="#iterating-over-the-values-in-a-vector">Iterating Over the Values in a Vector</a></h3>
<p>To access each element in a vector in turn, we would iterate through all the elements rather than use indices to access
one at a time. Listing 8-7 shows how to use a <code>for</code> loop to get immutable references to each element in a vector
of <code>i32</code> values and print them.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let v = vec![100, 32, 57];
    for i in &amp;v {
        println!(&quot;{i}&quot;);
    }
}</code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 8-7: Printing each element in a vector by iterating over the elements using a <code>for</code> loop</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also iterate over mutable references to each element in a mutable vector in order to make changes to all the
elements. The <code>for</code> loop in Listing 8-8 will add <code>50</code> to each element.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];
    for i in &amp;mut v {
        *i += 50;
    }
}</code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 8-8: Iterating over mutable references to elements in a vector</li>
</ul>
<p>To change the value that the mutable reference refers to, we have to use the <code>*</code> dereference operator to get to the
value in <code>i</code> before we can use the <code>+=</code> operator. We'll talk more about the dereference operator in &quot;Following the
Pointer to the Value&quot;.</p>
<p>Iterating over a vector, whether immutably or mutably, is safe because of the borrow checker's rules. If we attempted to
insert or remove items in the <code>for</code> loop bodies in Listing 8-7 and Listing 8-8, we would get a compiler error similar to
the one we got with the code in Listing 8-6. The reference to the vector that the <code>for</code> loop holds prevents simultaneous
modification of the whole vector.</p>
<h3 id="using-an-enum-to-store-multiple-types"><a class="header" href="#using-an-enum-to-store-multiple-types">Using an Enum to Store Multiple Types</a></h3>
<p>Vectors can only store values that are of the same type. This can be inconvenient; there are definitely use cases for
needing to store a list of items of different types. Fortunately, the variants of an enum are defined under the same
enum type, so when we need one type to represent elements of different types, we can define and use an enum!</p>
<p>For example, say we want to get values from a row in a spreadsheet in which some of the columns in the row contain
integers, some floating-point numbers, and some strings. We can define an enum whose variants will hold the different
value types, and all the enum variants will be considered the same type: that of the enum. Then we can create a vector
to hold that enum and so, ultimately, hold different types. We've demonstrated this in Listing 8-9.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">enum SpreadsheetCell {
    Int(i32),
    Float(f64),
    Text(String),
}

fn main() {
    let row = vec![
        SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
        SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from(&quot;blue&quot;)),
        SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
    ];
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 8-9: Defining an enum to store values of different types in one vector</li>
</ul>
<p>Rust needs to know what types will be in the vector at compile time so it knows exactly how much memory on the heap will
be needed to store each element. We must also be explicit about what types are allowed in this vector. If Rust allowed a
vector to hold any type, there would be a change that one or more of the types would cause errors with the operations
performed on the elements of the vector. Using an enum plus a <code>match</code> expression means that Rust will ensure at compile
time that every possible case is handled, as discussed in Chapter 6.</p>
<p>If you don't know the exhaustive set of types a program will get at runtime to store in a vector, the enum technique
won't work. Instead, you can use a trait object, which we'll cover in Chapter 17.</p>
<p>Now that we've discussed some of the most common ways to use vectors, be sure to review the API documentation for all of
the many useful methods defined on <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> by the standard library. For example, in addition to <code>push</code>, a <code>pop</code> method
removes and returns the last element.</p>
<h3 id="dropping-a-vector-drops-its-elements"><a class="header" href="#dropping-a-vector-drops-its-elements">Dropping a Vector Drops Its Elements</a></h3>
<p>Like any other <code>struct</code>, a vector is freed when it goes out of scope, as annotated in Listing 8-10.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">{
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];

    // do stuff with v
} // &lt;- v goes out of scope and is freed here</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 8-10: Showing where the vector and its elements are dropped</li>
</ul>
<p>When the vector gets dropped, all of its contents are also dropped, meaning the integers it holds will be cleaned up.
The borrow checker ensures that any references to contents of a vector are only used while the vector itself is valid.</p>
<p>Let's move on to the next collection type: <code>String</code>!</p>
<h2 id="storing-utf-8-encoded-text-with-strings"><a class="header" href="#storing-utf-8-encoded-text-with-strings">Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings</a></h2>
<p>We talked about strings in Chapter 4, but we'll look at them in more depth now. New Rustaceans commonly get stuck on
strings for a combination of three reasons: Rust's propesity for exposing possible errors, strings being a more
complicated data structure than many programmers give them credit for, and UTF-8. These factors combine in a way that
can seem difficult when you're coming from other programming languages.</p>
<p>We discuss strings in the context of collections because strings are implemented as a collection of bytes, plus some
methods to provide useful functionality when those bytes are interpreted as text. In this section, we'll talk about the
operations on <code>String</code> that every collection type has, such as creating, updating, and reading. We'll also discuss the
ways in which <code>String</code> is different from the other collections, namely how indexing into a <code>String</code> is complicated by
the differences between how people and computers interpret <code>String</code> data.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-string"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-string">What Is a String?</a></h3>
<p>We'll first define what we mean by the term string. Rust has only one string type in the core language, which is the
string slice <code>str</code> that is usually seen in its borrowed from <code>&amp;str</code>. In Chapter 4, we talked about string slices, which
are references to some UTF-8 encoded string data stored elsewhere. String literals, for example, are stored in the
program's binary and are therefore string slices.</p>
<p>The <code>String</code> type, which is provided by Rust's standard library rather than coded into the core language, is a growable,
mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type. When Rustaceans refer to &quot;strings&quot; in Rust, they might be referring to either
the <code>String</code> or the string slice <code>&amp;str</code> types, not just one of those types. Although this section is largely
about <code>String</code>, both types are used heavily in Rust's standard library, and both <code>String</code> and string slices are UTF-8
encoded.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-new-string"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-new-string">Creating a New String</a></h3>
<p>Many of the same operations available with <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> are available with <code>String</code> as well because <code>String</code> is actually
implemented as a wrapper around a vector of bytes with some extra guarantees, restrictions, and capabilities. An example
of a function that works the same way with <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>String</code> is the <code>new</code> function to create an instance, shown in
Listin g8-11.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let mut s = String::new();</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 8-11: Creating a new, empty <code>String</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This line creates a new, empty string called <code>s</code>, into which we can then load data. Often, we'll have some initial data
with which we want to start the string. For that, we use the <code>to_string</code> method, which is available on any type that
implements the <code>Display</code> trait, as string literals do. Listing 8-12 shows two examples.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let data = &quot;initial contents&quot;;
    
    let s = data.to_string();
    
    // The method also works on a literal directly:
    let s = &quot;initial contents&quot;.to_string();
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 8-12: Using the <code>to_string</code> method to create a <code>String</code> from a string literal</li>
</ul>
<p>This code creates a string containing <code>initial contents</code>.</p>
<p>We can also use the function <code>String::from</code> to create a <code>String</code> from a string literal. The code in Listing 8-13 is
equivalent to the code in Listing 8-12 that uses <code>to_string</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let s = String::from(&quot;initial contents&quot;);</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 8-13: Using the <code>String::from</code> function to create a `String from a string literal</li>
</ul>
<p>Because strings are used for so many things, we can use many different generic APIs for string, providing us with a lot
of options. Some of them can seem redundant, but they all have their place! In this case, <code>String::from</code> and <code>to_string</code>
do the same thing, so which one you choose is a matter of stype and readability.</p>
<p>Remember that strings are UTF-8 encoded, so we can include any properly encoded data in them, as shown in Listing 8-14.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let hello = String::from(&quot;عليكم السالم;(&quot;
let hello = String::from(&quot;Dobrý den&quot;);
let hello = String::from(&quot;Hello&quot;);
let hello = String::from(&quot;וםֹלָׁש;(&quot;
let hello = String::from(&quot;नमस्ते&quot;);
let hello = String::from(&quot;こんにちは&quot;);

<p>A <code>String</code> can grow in size and its contents can change, just like the contents of a <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, if you push more data
into it. In addition, you can conveniently use the <code>+</code> operator or the <code>format!</code> macro to concatenate <code>String</code> values.</p>

<p>We can grow a <code>String</code> by using the <code>push_str</code> method to append a string slice, as shown in Listing 8-15.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from(&quot;foo&quot;);
    s.push_str(&quot;bar&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 8-15: Appending a string slice to a <code>String</code> using the <code>push_str</code> method</li>
</ul>
<p>After these two lines, <code>s</code> will contain <code>foobar</code>. The <code>push_str</code> method takes a string slice because we don't
necessarily want to take ownership of the parameter. For example, in the code in Listing 8-16, we want to be able to
use <code>s2</code> after appending its contents to <code>s1</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let mut s1 = String::from(&quot;foo&quot;);
    let s2 = &quot;bar&quot;;
    s1.push_str(s2);

<ul>

<p>If the <code>push_str</code> method took ownership of <code>s2</code>, we wouldn't be able to print its value on the last line. However, this
code works as we'd expect!</p>
<p>The <code>push</code> method takes a single character as a parameter and adds it to the <code>String</code>. Listing 8-17 adds the letter l to
a <code>String</code> using the <code>push</code> method.</p>

<h4 id="concatenation-with-the--operator-or-the-format-macro"><a class="header" href="#concatenation-with-the--operator-or-the-format-macro">Concatenation with the + Operator or the format! Macro</a></h4>
<p>Often, you'll want to combine two existing strings. One way to do so is to use the <code>+</code> operator, as shown in Listing
8-18.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from(&quot;Hello, &quot;);
    let s2 = String::from(&quot;world!&quot;);
    let s3 = s1 + &amp;s2;  // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 8-18: Using the <code>+</code> operator to combine two <code>String</code> values into a new <code>String</code> value</li>
</ul>
<p>The string <code>s3</code> will contain <code>Hello, world!</code>. The reason <code>s1</code> is no longer valid after the addition, and the reason we
used a reference to <code>s2</code>, has to do with the signature of the method that's called when we use the <code>+</code> operator. The <code>+</code>
operator uses the <code>add</code> method, whose signature looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn add(self, s: &amp;str) -&gt; String {</code></pre>
<p>In the standard library, you'll see <code>add</code> defined using generics and associated types. Here, we've substituted in
concrete types, which is what happens when we call this method with <code>String</code> values. We'll discuss generics in Chapter
10.. This signature gives us the clues we need in order to understand the tricky bits of the <code>+</code> operator.</p>
<p>First, <code>s2</code> has an <code>&amp;</code>, meaning that we're adding a reference of the second string to the first string. This is because
of the <code>s</code> parameter in the <code>add</code> function: we can only add a <code>&amp;str</code> to a <code>String</code>; we can't add two <code>String</code> values
together. But wait--the type of <code>&amp;s2</code> is <code>&amp;String</code>, not <code>&amp;str</code>, as specified in the second parameter to <code>add</code>. So why
does Listing 8-18 compile?</p>
<p>The reason we're able to use <code>&amp;s2</code> in the call to <code>add</code> is that the compiler can coerce the <code>&amp;String</code> argument into
a <code>&amp;str</code>. When we call the <code>add</code> method, Rust uses a deref coercion, which here turns <code>&amp;s2</code> into <code>&amp;s2[..]</code>. We'll
discuss deref coercion in more depth in Chapter 15. Because <code>add</code> does not take ownership of the <code>s</code> parameter, <code>s2</code>
will still be a valid <code>String</code> after this operation.</p>
<p>Second, we can see in the signature that <code>add</code> takes ownership of <code>self</code> because <code>self</code> does not have an <code>&amp;</code>. This
means <code>s1</code> in Listing 8-18 will be moved into the <code>add</code> call and will no longer be valid after that. So,
although <code>let s3 = s1 + &amp;s2;</code> look like it will copy both strings and create a new one, this statement actually takes
ownership of <code>s1</code>, appends a copy of the contents of <code>s2</code>, and then returns ownership of the result. In other words, it
looks like it's making a lot of copies, but it isn't; the implementation is more efficient than copying.</p>
<p>If we need to concatenate multiple strings, the behavior of the <code>+</code> operator gets unwieldy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from(&quot;tic&quot;);
    let s2 = String::from(&quot;tac&quot;);
    let s3 = String::from(&quot;toe&quot;);
    
    let s = s1 + &quot;-&quot; + &amp;s2 + &quot;-&quot; + &amp;s3;
}</code></pre>
<p>At this point, <code>s</code> will be <code>tic-tac-toe</code>. The <code>format!</code> macro works like <code>println!</code>, but instead of printing the output
to the screen, it returns a <code>String</code> with the contents. The version of the code using <code>format!</code> is much easier to read,
and the code generated by the <code>format!</code> macro uses references so that this call doesn't take ownership of any of its
parameters.</p>
<h3 id="indexing-into-strings"><a class="header" href="#indexing-into-strings">Indexing into Strings</a></h3>
<p>In many other programming languages, accessing individual characters in a string by referencing them by index is a valid
and common operation. However, if you try to access parts of a <code>String</code> using indexing syntax in Rust, you'll get an
error. Consider the invalid code in Listing 8-19.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The error and the note tell the story: Rust strings don't support indexing. But why not? To answer that question, we
need to discuss how Rust stores strings in memory.</p>
<h4 id="interanl-representation"><a class="header" href="#interanl-representation">Interanl Representation</a></h4>
<p>A <code>String</code> is a wrapper over a <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code>. Let's look at some of our properly encoded UTF-8 example strings from Listing
8-14. First, this one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let hello = String::from(&quot;Hola&quot;);</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>len</code> will be 4, which means the vector storing the string <code>&quot;Hola&quot;</code> is 4 bytes long. Each of these letters
take one byte when encoded in UTF-8. The following line, however, may surprise you (note that this string begins with
the capital Cyrillic letter Ze, not the Arabic number 3):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let hello = String::from(&quot;Здравствуйте&quot;);</code></pre>
<p>If you were asked how long the string is, you might say 12. In fact, Rust's answer is 24: that's the number of bytes it
takes to encode <code>&quot;Здравствуйте&quot;</code> in UTF-8, because each Unicode scalar value in that string takes 2 bytes of storage.
THerefore, an index into the string's bytes will not always correlate to a valid Unicode scalar value. To demonstrate,
consider this invalid Rust code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn main() {
    let hello = &quot;Здравствуйте&quot;;
    let answer = &amp;hello[0];
}</code></pre>
<p>You already know that <code>answer</code> will not be <code>З</code>, the first letter. When encoded in UTF-8, the first byte of <code>З</code> is <code>208</code>
and the second is <code>151</code>, so it would seem that <code>answer</code> should in fact be <code>208</code>, but <code>208</code> is not a valid character on
its own. Returning <code>208</code> is likely not what a user would want if they asked for the first letter of this string;
however, that's the only data that Rust has at byte index 0. Users generally don't want the byte value returned, even if
the string contains only Latin letters: if <code>&amp;&quot;hello&quot;[0]</code> were valid code that returned the byte value, it would
return <code>104</code>, not <code>h</code>.</p>
<p>The answer, then, is that to avoid returning an unexpected value and causing bugs that might not be discovered
immediately, Rust doesn't compile this code at all and prevents misunderstandings early in the development process.</p>
<h4 id="bytes-and-scalar-values-and-grapheme-clusters-oh-my"><a class="header" href="#bytes-and-scalar-values-and-grapheme-clusters-oh-my">Bytes and Scalar Values and Grapheme Clusters! Oh My!</a></h4>
<p>Another point about UTF-8 is that there are actually three relevant ways to look at strings from Rust's prespective: as
bytes, scalar values, and grapheme clusters (the closest thing to what we would call letters).</p>
<p>If we look at the Hindi word नमस्त े written in the Devanagari script, it is stored as a vector of <code>u8</code> values that
looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[224, 164, 168, 224, 164, 174, 224, 164, 184, 224, 165, 141, 224,
164, 164, 224, 165, 135]
</code></pre>
<p>That's 18 bytes and is how computers ultimately store this data. If we look at them as Unicode scalar values, which are
what Rust's <code>char</code> type is, those bytes look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">['न', 'म', 'स', '◌्', 'त', '◌े']
</code></pre>
<p>There are six <code>char</code> values here, but the fourth and sixth are not letters: they're diacritics that don't make sense on
their own. Finally, if we look at them as grapheme clusters, we'd get what a person would call the four letters that
make up the Hindi word:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[&quot;न&quot;, &quot;म&quot;, &quot;स्&quot;, &quot;ते&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Rust provides different ways of interpreting the raw string data that computers store so that each program can choose
the interpretation it needs, no matter what human language the data is in.</p>
<p>A final reason Rust doesn't allow us to index into a <code>String</code> to get a character is that indexing operations are
expected to always take constant time (O(1)). But it isn't possible to guarantee that performance with a <code>String</code>,
because Rust would have to walk through the contents from the beginning to the index to determine how many valid
characters there were.</p>
<h3 id="slicing-strings"><a class="header" href="#slicing-strings">Slicing Strings</a></h3>
<p>Indexing into a string is often a bad idea because it's not clear what the return type of the string-indexing operation
should be: a byte value, a character, a grapheme cluster, or a string slice. If you really need to use indices to create
string slices, therefore, Rust asks you to be more specific.</p>
<p>Rather than indexing using <code>[]</code> with a single number, you can use <code>[]</code> with a range to create a string slice containing
particular bytes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">let hello = &quot;Здравствуйте&quot;;

let s = &amp;hello[0..4];</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>s</code> will be a <code>&amp;str</code> that contains the first four bytes of the string.</p>
<p>Earlier, we mentioned that each of these characters was two bytes, which means <code>s</code> will be <code>Зд</code>.</p>
<p>If we were to try to slice only part of a character's bytes with something like <code>&amp;hello[0..1]</code>, Rust would panic at
runtime in the same way as if an invalid index were accessed in a vector:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">thread 'main' panicked at 'byte index 1 is not a char boundary;
it is inside 'З' (bytes 0..2) of `Здравствуйте`', src/main.rs:4:14
</code></pre>
<p>You should use caution when creating string slices with ranges, because doing so can crash your program.</p>
<h3 id="methods-for-iterating-over-strings"><a class="header" href="#methods-for-iterating-over-strings">Methods for Iterating Over Strings</a></h3>
<p>The best way to operate on pieces of strings is to be explicit about whether you want characters or bytes. For
individual Unicode scalar values, use the <code>chars</code> method. Calling <code>chars</code> on &quot;Зд&quot; separates out and returns two values
of type <code>char</code>, and you can iterate over the result to access each element:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">for c in &quot;Зд&quot;.chars() {
    println!(&quot;{c}&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<p>This code will print the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">З
д
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, the <code>bytes</code> method returns each raw byte, which might be appropriate for your domain:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">for b in &quot;Зд&quot;.bytes() {
    println!(&quot;{b}&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<p>This code will print the four bytes that make up this string:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">208
151
208
180
</code></pre>
<p>But be sure to remember that valid Unicode scalar values may be made up of more than one byte.</p>
<p>Getting grapheme clusters from strings, as with the Devanagari script, is complex, so this functionality is not provided
by the standard library. Crates are available at https://crates.io if this is the functionality you need.</p>
<h3 id="strings-are-not-so-simple"><a class="header" href="#strings-are-not-so-simple">Strings Are Not So Simple</a></h3>
<p>To summarize, strings are complicated. Different programming languages make different choices about how to present this
complexity to the programmer. Rust has chosen to make the correct handling of <code>String</code> data the default behavior for all
Rust programs, which means programmers have to put more thought into handling UTF-8 data up front. This trade-off
exposes more of the complexity of strings than is apparent in other programming languages, but it prevents you from
having to handle error involving non-ASCII characters later in your development life cycle.</p>
<p>The good news is that the standard library offers a lot of functionality build off the <code>String</code> and <code>&amp;str</code> types to help
handle these complex situations correctly. Be sure to check out the documentation for useful methods like <code>contains</code> for
searching in a string and <code>replace</code> for substituting parts of a string with another string.</p>
<p>Let's switch to something a bit less complex: hash maps!</p>
<h2 id="storing-keys-with-associated-values-in-hash-maps"><a class="header" href="#storing-keys-with-associated-values-in-hash-maps">Storing Keys with Associated Values in Hash Maps</a></h2>
<p>The last of our common collections is the hash map. The type <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code> stores a mapping of keys of type <code>K</code> to
values of type <code>V</code> using a hashing function, which determines how it places these keys and values into memory. Many
programming languages support this kind of data structure, but they often use a different name, such has hash, map,
object, hash table, dictionary, or associative array, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Hash maps are useful when you want to look up data not by using an index, as you can with vectors, but by using a key
that can be of any type. For example, in a game, you could keep track of each team's score in a hash map in which each
key is a team's name and the values are each team's score. Given a team name, you can retrieve its score.</p>
<p>We'll go over the basic API of hash maps in this section, but many more goodies are hiding in the functions defined
on <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code> by the standard library. As always, check the standard library documentation for more information.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-new-hash-map"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-new-hash-map">Creating a New Hash Map</a></h3>
<p>One way to create an empty hash map is to use <code>new</code> and to add elements with <code>insert</code>. In Listing 8-20, we're keeping
track of the scores of two teams whose names are Blue and Yellow. The Blue team starts with 10 points, and the Yellow
team starts with 50.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">use std::collections::HashMap;

<ul>
<li>Listing 8-20: Creating a new hash map and inserting some keys and values</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we need to first <code>use</code> the <code>HashMap</code> from the collections portion of the standard library. Of our three common
collections, this one is the least often used, so it's not included in the features brought into scope automatically in
the prelude. Hash maps also have less support from the standard library; there's no built-in macro to construct them,
for example.</p>
<p>Just like vectors, hash maps store their data on the heap. This <code>HashMap</code> has keys of type <code>String</code> and values of
type <code>i32</code>. Like vectors, hash maps are homogeneous: all of the keys must have the same type, and all of the values must
have the same type.</p>

time (but not vice versa: for example, both the Blue team and the Yellow team could have the value <code>10</code> stored in
the <code>scores</code> hash map).</p>
<p>When you want to change the data in a hash map, you have to decide how to handle the case when a key already has a value
assigned. You could replace the old value with the new value, completely disregarding the old value. You could keep the
old value and ignore the new value, only adding the new value if the key doesn't already have a value. Or you could
combine the old value and the new value. Let's look at how to do each of these!</p>

<p>It's common to check whether a particular key already exists in the hash map with a value and then to take the following
actions: if the key does exist in the hash map, the existing value should remain the way it is; if the key doesn't
exist, insert it and a value for it.</p>
<p>Hash maps have a special API for this called <code>entry</code> that takes the key you want to check as a parameter. The return
value of the <code>entry</code> method is an enum called <code>Entry</code> that represents a value that might or might not exist. Let's say
we want to check whether the key for the Yellow team has a value associated with it. If it doesn't we want to insert the
value <code>50</code>, and the same for the Blue team. Using the <code>entry</code> API, the code looks like Listing 8-24.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut scores = HashMap::new();
    scores.insert(String::from(&quot;Blue&quot;), 10);
    
    scores.entry(String::from(&quot;Yello&quot;)).or_insert(50);
    scores.entry(String::from(&quot;Blue&quot;)).or_insert(50);
    
    println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, scores);
}</code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 8-24: Using the <code>entry</code> method to only insert if the key does not already have a value</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>or_insert</code> method on <code>Entry</code> is defined to return a mutable reference to the value for the corresponding <code>Entry</code>
key if that key exists, and if not, it inserts the parameter as the new value for this key and returns a mutable
reference to the new value. This technique is much cleaner than writing the logic ourselves and, in addition, plays more
nicely with the borrow checker.</p>
<p>Running the code in Listing 8-24 will print <code>{&quot;Yellow&quot;: 50, &quot;Blue&quot;: 10}</code>. The first call to <code>entry</code> will insert the key
for the Yellow team with the value <code>50</code> because the Yellow team doesn't have a value already. The second call to <code>entry</code>
will not change the hash map because the Blue team already has the value <code>10</code>.</p>
<h4 id="updating-a-value-based-on-the-old-value"><a class="header" href="#updating-a-value-based-on-the-old-value">Updating a Value Based on the Old Value</a></h4>
<p>Another common use case for hash maps is to look up a key's value and then update it based on the old value. For
instance, Listing 8-25 shows code that counts how many times each word appears in some text. We use a hash map with the
words as keys and increment the value to keep track of how many times we've seen that word. If it's the first time we've
seen a word, we'll first insert the value <code>0</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let text = &quot;hello world wonderful world&quot;;

    let mut map = HashMap::new();

    for word in text.split_whitespace() {
        let count = map.entry(word).or_insert(0);
        *count += 1;
    }

    println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, map);
}</code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 8-25: Counting occurrences of words using a hash map that stores words and counts</li>
</ul>
<p>This code will print <code>{&quot;world&quot;: 2, &quot;hello&quot;: 1, &quot;wonderful&quot;: 1}</code>. You might see the same key-value pairs printed in a
different order: recall from &quot;Accessing Values in a Hash Map&quot; that iterating over a hash map happens in an arbitrary
order.</p>
<p>The <code>split_whitespace</code> method returns an iterator over subslices, separated by whitespace, of the value in <code>text</code>.
The <code>or_insert</code> method returns a mutable reference <code>(&amp;mut V)</code> to the value for the specified key. Here, we store that
mutable reference in the <code>count</code> variable, so in order to assign to that value, we must first dereference <code>count</code> using
the asterisk(<code>*</code>). The mutable reference goes out of scope at the end of the <code>for</code> loop, so all of these changes are
safe and allowed by the borrowing rules.</p>
<h3 id="hashing-functions"><a class="header" href="#hashing-functions">Hashing Functions</a></h3>
<p>By default, <code>HashMap</code> uses a hashing function called SipHash that can provide resistance to denial-of-service (DoS)
attacks involving hash tables. This is not the fastest hashing algorithm available, but the trade-off for better
security that comes with the drop in performance is worth it. If you profile your code and find that the default hash
function is too slow for your purposes, you can switch to another function by specifying a different hasher. A hasher is
a type that implements the <code>BuildHasher</code> trait. We'll talk about traits and how to implement them in Chapter 10. You
don't necessarily have to implement your own hasher from scratch; https://crates.io has libraries shared by other Rust
users that provide hashers implementing many common hashing algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="summary-7"><a class="header" href="#summary-7">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Vectors, strings, and hash maps will provide a large amount of functionality necessary in programs when you need to
store, access, and modify data. Here are some exercises you should now be equipped to solve:</p>
<ol>
<li>Given a list of integers, use a vector and return the median (when sorted, the value in the middle position) and
mode (the value that occurs most often; a hash map will be helpful here) of the list.</li>
<li>Convert strings to pig latin. The first consonant of each word is moved to the end of the word and ay is added, so
first becomes irst-fay. Words that start with a vowel have hay added to the end instead (apple becomes apple-hay).
Keep in mind the details about UTF-8 encoding!</li>
<li>Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add employee names to a department in a
company; for example, &quot;Add Sally to Engineering&quot; or &quot;Add Amir to Sales&quot;. Then let the user retrieve a list of all
people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted alphabetically.</li>
</ol>
<p>The standard library API documentation describes methods that vectors, strings, and hash maps have that will be helpful
for these exercises!</p>
<p>We're getting into more complex programs in which operations can fail, so it's a perfect time to discuss error handling.
We'll do that next!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="error-handling"><a class="header" href="#error-handling">Error Handling</a></h1>
<p>Errors are a fact of life in software, so Rust has a number of features for handling situations in which something goes
wrong. In many cases, Rust requires you to acknowledge the possibility of an error and take some action before your code
will compile. This requirement makes your program more robust by ensuring that you'll discover errors and handle them
appropriately before deploying your code to production!</p>
<p>Rust groups errors into two major categories: recoverable and unrecoverable errors. For a recoverable error, such as a
file not found error, we most likely just want to report the problem to the user and retry the operation. Unrecoverable
errors are always symptoms of bugs, such as trying to access a location beyond the end of an array, and so we want to
immediately stop the program.</p>
<p>Most languages don't distinguish between these two kinds of errors and handle both in the same way, using mechanisms
such as exceptions. Rust doesn't have exceptions. Instead, it has the type <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> for recoverable errors and
the <code>panic!</code> macro that stops execution when the program encounters an unrecoverable error. This chapter covers
calling <code>panic!</code> first and then talks about returning <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> values. Additionally, we'll explore considerations
when deciding whether to try to recover from an error or to stop execution.</p>
<h2 id="unrecoverable-errors-with-panic"><a class="header" href="#unrecoverable-errors-with-panic">Unrecoverable Errors with panic!</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes bad things happen in your code, and there's nothing you can do about it. In these cases, Rust has the <code>panic!</code>
macro. There are two ways to cause a panic in practice: by taking an action that causes our code to panic(such as
accessing an array past the end) or by explicitly calling the <code>panic!</code> macro. In both cases, we cause a panic in our
program. By default, these panics will print a failure message, unwind, clean up the stack, and quit. Via an environment
variable, you can also have Rust display the call stack when a panic occurs to make it easier to track down the source
of the panic.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="unwinding-the-stack-or-aborting-in-response-to-a-panic"><a class="header" href="#unwinding-the-stack-or-aborting-in-response-to-a-panic">Unwinding the stack or aborting in response to a panic</a></h4>
<p>By default, when a panic occurs the program starts unwinding, which means Rust walks back up the stack and cleans up
the data from each function it encounters. However, walking back and cleaning up is a lot of work. Rust, therefore,
allows you to choose the alternative of immediately aborting, which ends the program without cleaning up.</p>
<p>Memory that the program was using will then need to be cleaned up by the operating system. If in your project you need
to make the resultant binary as small as possible, you can switch from unwinding to aborting upon a panic by
adding <code>panic = 'abort'</code> to the appropriate <code>[profile]</code> sections in your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file. For example, if you want
to
abort on panic in release mode, add this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[profile.release]
panic = 'abort'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's try calling <code>panic!</code> in a simple program:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    panic!(&quot;crash and burn&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>When you run the program, you'll see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">thread 'main' panicked at 'crash and burn', src\main.rs:2:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
</code></pre>
<p>The call to <code>panic!</code> causes the error message contained in the last two lines. The first line shows our panic message
and the place in our source code where the panic occurred: <code>src/main.rs:2:5</code> indicates that it's the second line, fifth
character of our <code>src/main.rs</code> file.</p>
<p>In this case, the line indicated is part of our code, and if we go to that line, we see the <code>panic!</code> macro call. In
other cases, the <code>panic!</code> call might be in code that our code calls, and the filename and line number reported by the
error message will be someone else's code where the <code>panic!</code> macro is called, not the line of our code that eventually
led to the <code>panic!</code> call.</p>
<p>We can use the backtrace of the functions the <code>panic!</code> call came from to figure out the part of our code that is causing
the problem. To understand how to use a <code>panic!</code> backtrace, let's look at another example and see what it's like when
a <code>panic!</code> call comes from a library because of a bug in our code instead of from our code calling the macro directly.
Listing 9-1 has some code that attempts to access an index in a vector beyond the range of valid indexes.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    
    v[99];
}</code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 9-1: Attempting to access an element beyond the end of a vector, which will cause a call to <code>panic!</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Here, we're attempting to access the 100th element of our vector (which is at index 99 because indexing starts at zero),
but the vector has only three elements. In this situation, Rust will panic. Using <code>[]</code> is supposed to return an element,
but if you pass an invalid index, there's no element that Rust could return here that would be correct.</p>
<p>In C, attempting to read beyond the end of a data structure is undefined behavior. You might get whatever is at the
location in memory that would correspond to that element in the data structure, even though the memory doesn't belong to
that structure. This is called a buffer overread and can lead to security vulnerabilities if an attacker is able to
manipulate the index in such a way as to read data they shouldn't be allowed to that is stored after the data structure.</p>
<p>To protect your program from this sort of vulnerability, if you try to read an element at an index that doesn't exist,
Rust will stop execution and refuse to continue. Let's try it and see:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 3 but the index is 99', src\main.rs:4:5
note: Some details are omitted, run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` for a verbose backtrace.
</code></pre>
<p>This error points at line 4 of our <code>main.rs</code> where we attempt to access <code>index</code>. The <code>note:</code> line tells us that we can
set the <code>RUST_BACKTRACE</code> environment variable to get a backtrace of exactly what happened to cause the error. A
backtrace is a list of all the functions that have been called to get to this point. Backtraces in Rust work as they do
in other languages: the key to reading the backtrace is to start from the top and read until you see files you wrote.
That's the spot where the problem originated. The lines above that spot are code that your code has called; the lines
below are code that called your code. These before-and-after lines might include core Rust code, standard library code,
or crates that you're using. Let's try getting a backtrace by setting the <code>RUST_BACKTRACE</code> environment variable to any
value except <code>0</code>. Listing 9-2 shows output similar to what you'll see.</p>

<li>Listing 9-2: The backtrace generated by a call to <code>panic!</code> displayed when the environment variable <code>RUST_BACKTRACE</code> is

</ul>
<p>That's a lot of output! The exact output you see might be different depending on your operating system and Rust version.
In order to get backtraces with this information, debug symbols must be enabled. Debug symbols are enabled by default
when using <code>cargo build</code> or <code>cargo run</code> without the <code>--release</code> flag, as we have here.</p>
<p>In the output in Listing 9-2, line 6 of the backtrace points to the line in our project that's causing the problem: line
4 of <code>src/main.rs</code>. If we don't want our program to panic, we should start our investigation at the location pointed too
by the first line mentioning a file we wrote. In Listing 9-1, where we deliberately wrote code that would panic, the way
to fix the panic is to not request an element beyond the range of the vector indexes. When your code panics in the
future, you'll need to figure out what action the code is taking with what values to cause the panic and what the code
should do instead.</p>
<p>We'll come back to <code>panic!</code> and when we should and should not use <code>panic!</code> to handle error conditions in &quot;To panic! or
Not to panic!&quot;. Next, we'll look at how to recover from an error using <code>Result</code>.</p>
<h2 id="recoverable-errors-with-result"><a class="header" href="#recoverable-errors-with-result">Recoverable Errors with Result</a></h2>
<p>Most errors aren't serious enough to require the program to stop entirely. Sometimes when a function fails it's for a
reason that you can easily interpret and respond to. For example, if you try to open a file and that operation fails
because the file doesn't exist, you might want to create the file instead of terminating the process.</p>
<p>Recall from &quot;Handling Potential Failure with Result&quot; that the <code>Result</code> enum is defined as having two variants, <code>Ok</code>
and <code>Err</code>, as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">enum Result&lt;T, E&gt; {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>T</code> and <code>E</code> are generic type parameters: we'll discuss generics in more detail in Chapter 10. What you need to know
right now is that <code>T</code> represents the type of the value that will be returned in a success case within the <code>Ok</code> variant,
and <code>E</code> represents the type of the error that will be returned in a failure case within the <code>Err</code> variant.
Because <code>Result</code> has these generic type parameters, we can use the <code>Result</code> type and the functions defined on it in many
different situations where the success value and error value we want to return may differ.</p>
<p>Let's call a function that returns a <code>Result</code> value because the function could fail. In Listing 9-3 we try to open a
file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 9-3: Opening a file</li>
</ul>
<p>The return type of <code>File::open</code> is a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>. The generic parameter <code>T</code> has been filled in by the implementation
of <code>File::open</code> with the type of the success value, <code>std::fs::File</code>, which is a file handle. The type of <code>E</code> used in the
error value is <code>std::io::Error</code>. This return type means the call to <code>File::open</code> might succeed and return a file handle
that we can read from or write to. The function call also might fail: for example, the file might not exist, or we might
not have permission to access the file. The <code>File::open</code> function needs to have a way to tell us whether it succeeded of
failed and at the same time give us either the file handle or error information. This information is exactly what
the <code>Result</code> enum conveys.</p>
<p>In the case where <code>File::open</code> succeeds, the value in the variable <code>greeting_file_result</code> will be an instance of <code>Ok</code>
that contains a file handle. In the case where it fails, the value in <code>greeting_file_result</code> will be an instance
of <code>Err</code> that contains more information about the kind of error that occurred.</p>
<p>We need to add to the code in Listing 9-3 to take different actions depending on the value <code>File::open</code> returns. Listing
9-4 shows one way to handle the <code>Result</code> using a basic tool, the <code>match</code> expression that we discussed in Chapter 6.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;);

    let greeting_file = match greeting_file_result {
        Ok(file) =&gt; file,
        Err(error) =&gt; {
            panic!(&quot;Problem opening the file: {:?}&quot;, error);
        }
    };
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 9-4: Using a <code>match</code> expression to handle the <code>Result</code> variants that might be returned</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, like the <code>Option</code> enum, the <code>Result</code> enum and its variants have been brought into scope by the prelude, so we
don't need to specify <code>Result::</code> before the <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code> variants in the <code>match</code> arms.</p>
<p>When the result is <code>Ok</code>, this code will return the inner <code>file</code> value out of the <code>Ok</code> variant, and we then assign that
file handle value to the variable <code>greeting_file</code>. After the <code>match</code>, we can use the file handle for reading or writing.</p>
<p>The other arm of the <code>match</code> handles the case where we get an <code>Err</code> value from <code>File::open</code>. In this example, we've
chosen to call the <code>panic!</code> macro. If there's no file named hello.txt in our current directory and we run this code,
we'll see the following output from the <code>panic!</code> macro:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">thread 'main' panicked at 'Problem opening the file: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: &quot;The system cannot find the file specified.&quot; }', src\main.rs:9:13
</code></pre>
<p>As usual, this output tells us exactly what has gone wrong.</p>
<h3 id="matching-on-different-errors"><a class="header" href="#matching-on-different-errors">Matching on Different Errors</a></h3>
<p>The code in Listing 9-4 will <code>panic!</code> no matter why <code>File::open</code> failed. However, we want to take different actions for
different failure reasons. If <code>File::open</code> failed because the file doesn't exist, we want to create the file and return
the handle to the new file. If <code>File::open</code> failed for any other reason - for example, because we didn't have permission
to open the file - we still want the code to <code>panic!</code> in the same way it did in Listing 9-4. For this, we add an
inner <code>match</code> expression, shown in Listing 9-5.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::fs::File;
use std::io::ErrorKind;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;);

        },
    };
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 9-5: Handling different kinds of errors in different ways</li>
</ul>
<p>The type of the value that <code>File::open</code> returns inside the <code>Err</code> variants is <code>io::Error</code>, which is a struct provided by
the standard library. This struct has a method <code>kind</code> that we can call to get an <code>io::ErrorKind</code> value. The
enum <code>io::ErrorKind</code> is provided by the standard library and has variants representing the different kinds of errors
that might result from an <code>io</code> operation. The variant we want to use is <code>ErrorKind::NotFound</code>, which indicates the file
we're trying to open doesn't exist yet. So we match on <code>greeting_file_result</code>, but we also have an inner match
on <code>error.kind()</code>.</p>
<p>The condition we want to check in the inner match is whether the value returned by <code>error.kind()</code> is the <code>NotFound</code>
variant of the <code>ErrorKind</code> enum. If it is, we try to create the file with <code>File::create</code>. However,
because <code>File::create</code> could also fail, we need a second arm in the inner <code>match</code> expression. When the file can't be
created, a different error message is printed. The second arm of the outer <code>match</code> stays the same, so the program panics
on any error besides the missing file error.</p>
<h4 id="alternatives-to-using-match-with-resultt-e"><a class="header" href="#alternatives-to-using-match-with-resultt-e">Alternatives to Using match with Result&lt;T, E&gt;</a></h4>
<p>That's a lot of <code>match</code>! The <code>match</code> expression is very useful but also very much a primitive. In Chapter 13, you'll
learn about closures, which are used with many of the methods defined on <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>. These methods can be more
concise than using <code>match</code> when handling <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> values in your code.</p>
<p>For example, here's another way to write the same logic as shown in Listing 9-5, this time using closures and
the <code>unwrap_or_else</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::fs::File;
use std::io::ErrorKind;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;).unwrap_or_else(|error| {
        if error.kind() == ErrorKind::NotFound {
            File::create(&quot;hello.txt&quot;).unwrap_or_else(|error| {
                panic!(&quot;Problem creating the file: {:?}&quot;, error);
            })
        } else {
            panic!(&quot;Problem opening the file: {:?}&quot;, error);
        }
    });
}</code></pre>
<p>Although this code has the same behavior as Listing 9-5, it doesn't contain any <code>match</code> expressions and is cleaner to
read. Come back to this example after you've read Chapter 13, and look up the <code>unwrap_or_else</code> method in the standard
library documentation. Many more of these methods can clean up huge nested <code>match</code> expressions when you're dealing with
errors.</p>
<h4 id="shortcuts-for-panic-on-error-unwrap-and-expect"><a class="header" href="#shortcuts-for-panic-on-error-unwrap-and-expect">Shortcuts for Panic on Error: unwrap and expect</a></h4>
<p>Using <code>match</code> works well enough, but it can be a bit verbose and doesn't always communicate intent well.
The <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> type has many helper methods defined on it to do various, more specific tasks. The <code>unwrap</code> method is
a shorcut method implemented just like the <code>match</code> expression we wrote in Listing 9-4. If the <code>Result</code> value is the <code>Ok</code>
variant, <code>unwrap</code> will return the value inside the <code>Ok</code>. If the <code>Result</code> is the <code>Err</code> variant, <code>unwrap</code> will call
the <code>panic!</code> macro for us. Here is an example of <code>unwrap</code> in action:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;).unwrap();
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>If we run this code without a hello.txt file, we'll see an error message from the <code>panic!</code> call that the <code>unwrap</code> method
makes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: &quot;The system cannot find the file specified.&quot; }', src\main.rs:4:49
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, the <code>expect</code> method lets us also choose the <code>panic!</code> error message. Using <code>expect</code> instead of <code>unwrap</code> and
providing good error messages can convey your intent and make traking down the source of a panic easier. The syntax
of <code>expect</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable edition2021">use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;)
        .expect(&quot;hello.txt should be included in this project&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We use <code>expect</code> in the same way as <code>unwrap</code>: to return the file handle or call the <code>panic!</code> macro. The error message
used by <code>expect</code> in its call to <code>panic!</code> will be the parameter that we pass to <code>expect</code>, rather than the
default <code>panic!</code> message that <code>unwrap</code> uses. Here's what it looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">thread 'main' panicked at 'hello.txt should be included in this project: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: &quot;The system cannot find the file specified.&quot; }', src\main.rs:5:10
</code></pre>
<p>In production-quality code, most Rustaceans choose <code>expect</code> rather than <code>unwrap</code> and give more context about why the
operation is expected to always succeed. That way, if your assumptions are ever proven wrong, you have more information
to use in debugging.</p>
<h3 id="propagating-errors"><a class="header" href="#propagating-errors">Propagating Errors</a></h3>
<p>When a function's implementation calls something that might fail, instead of handling the error within the function
itself, you can return the error to the calling code so that it can decide what to do. This is known as propagating the
error and gives more control to the calling code, where there might be more information or logic that dictates how the
error should be handled than what you have available in the context of your code.</p>
<p>For example, Listing 9-6 shows a function that reads a username from a file. If the file doesn't exist or can't be read,
this function will return those errors to the code that called the function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_username_from_file() -&gt; Result&lt;String, io::Error&gt; {     // 1
    let username_file_result = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;);         // 2

    let mut username_file = match username_file_result {        // 3
        Ok(file) =&gt; file,           // 4
        Err(e) =&gt; return Err(e),    // 5
    };

    let mut username = String::new();       // 6

    match username_file.read_to_string(&amp;mut username) {         // 7
        Ok(_) =&gt; Ok(username),      // 8
        Err(e) =&gt; Err(e),           // 9
    }
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 9-6: A function that returns errors to the calling code using <code>match</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This function can be written in a much shorter way, but we're going to start by doing a lot of it manually in order to
explore error handling; at the end, we'll show the shorter way. Let's look at the return type of the function
first: <code>Result&lt;String, io::Error&gt;</code> (1). This means the function is returning a value of the type <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>, where
the generic parameter <code>T</code> has been filled in with the concrete type <code>String</code> and the generic type <code>E</code> has been filled in
with the concrete type <code>io::Error</code>.</p>
<p>If this function succeeds without any problems, the code that calls this function will receive an <code>Ok</code> value that holds
a <code>String</code> - the <code>username</code> that this function read from the file (8). If this function encounters any problems, the
calling code will receive an <code>Err</code> value that holds an instance of <code>io::Error</code> that contains more information about what
the problems were. We chose <code>io::Error</code> as the return type of this function because that happens to be the type of the
error value returned from both of the operations we're calling in this function's body that might fail: the <code>File::open</code>
function (2) and the <code>read_to_string</code> method (7).</p>
<p>The body of the function starts by calling the <code>File::open</code> function (2). Then we handle the <code>Result</code> value with
a <code>match</code> similar to the <code>match</code> in Listing 9-4. If <code>File::open</code> succeeds, the file handle in the pattern
variable <code>file</code> (4) becomes the value in the mutable variable <code>username_file</code> (3) and the function continues. In
the <code>Err</code> case, instead of calling <code>panic!</code>, we use the <code>return</code> keyword to return ealy out of the function entirely and
pass the error value from <code>File::open</code>, now in the pattern variable, <code>e</code>, back to the calling code as this function's
error value (5).</p>
<p>So, if we have a file handle in <code>username_file</code>, the function then creates a new <code>String</code> in variable <code>username</code> (6) and
calls the <code>read_to_string</code> method on the file handle in <code>username_file</code> to read the contents of thef ile
into <code>username</code> (7). The <code>read_to_string</code> method also returns a <code>Result</code> because is might fail, even though <code>File::open</code>
succeeds, then our function has succeeded, and we return the username from the file that's now in <code>username</code> wrapped in
an <code>Ok</code>. If <code>read_to_string</code> fails, we return the error value in the same way that we returned the error value in
the <code>match</code> that handled the return value of <code>File::open</code>. However, we don't need to explicitly say <code>return</code>, because
this is the last expression in the function (9).</p>
<p>The code that calls this code will then handle getting either an <code>Ok</code> value that contains a username or an <code>Err</code> value
that contains an <code>io::Error</code>. It's up to the calling code to decide what to do with those values. If the calling code
gets an <code>Err</code> value, it could call <code>panic!</code> and crash the program, use a default username, or look up the username from
somewhere other than a file, for example. We don't have enough information on what the calling code is actually trying
to do, so we propagate all thes success or error information upward for it to handle appropriately.</p>
<p>This pattern of propagating errors is so common in Rust that Rust provides the question mark operator <code>?</code> to make this
easier.</p>
<h4 id="a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator"><a class="header" href="#a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator">A Shortcut for Propagating Errors: The ? Operator</a></h4>
<p>Listing 9-7 shows an implementation of <code>read_username_from_file</code> that has the same functionality as in Listing 9-6, but
this implementation uses the <code>?</code> operator.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_username_from_file() -&gt; Result&lt;String, io::Error&gt; {
    let mut username_file = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;)?;
    let mut username = String::new();
    username_file.read_to_string(&amp;mut username)?;
    Ok(username)
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 9-7: A function that returns errors to the calling code using the <code>?</code> operator</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>?</code> placed after a <code>Result</code> value is defined to work in almost the same way as the <code>match</code> expressions we defined to
handle the <code>Result</code> values in Listing 9-6. If the value of the <code>Result</code> is an <code>Ok</code>, the value the value inside the <code>Ok</code>
will get returned from this expression, and the program will continue. If the value is an <code>Err</code>, the <code>Err</code> will be
returned from the whole function as if we had used the <code>return</code> keyword so the error value gets propagated to the
calling code.</p>
<p>There is a difference between what the <code>match</code> expression from Listing 9-6 does and what the <code>?</code> operator does: error
values that have the <code>?</code> operator called on them go through the <code>from</code> function, defined in the <code>From</code> trait in the
standard library, which is used to convert values from one type into another. When the <code>?</code> operator calls the <code>from</code>
function, the error type received is converted into the error type defined in the return type of the current function.
This is useful when a function returns one error type to represent all the ways a function might fail, even if parts
might fail for many different reasons.</p>
<p>For example, we could change the <code>read_username_from_file</code> function in Listing 9-7 to return a custom error type
named <code>OurError</code> that we define. If we also define <code>impl From&lt;io::Error&gt; for OurError</code> to construct an instance
of <code>OurError</code> from an <code>io::Error</code>, then the <code>?</code> operator calls in the body of <code>read_username_from_file</code> will call <code>from</code>
and convert the error types without needing to add any more code to the function.</p>
<p>In the context of Listing 9-7, the <code>?</code> at the end of the <code>File::open</code> call will return the value inside an <code>Ok</code> to the
variable <code>username_file</code>. If an error occurs, the <code>?</code> operator will return early out of the whole function and give
any <code>Err</code> value to the calling code. The same thing applies to the <code>?</code> at the end of the <code>read_to_string</code> call.</p>
<p>The <code>?</code> operator eliminates a lot of boilerplate and makes this function's implementation simpler. We could even shorten
this code further by chaining method calls immediately after the <code>?</code>, as shown in Listing 9-8.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_username_from_file() -&gt; Result&lt;String, io::Error&gt; {
    let mut username = String::new();

    File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;)?.read_to_string(&amp;mut username)?;

    Ok(username)
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 9-8: Chaining method calls after the <code>?</code> operator</li>
</ul>
<p>We've moved the creation of the new <code>String</code> in <code>username</code> to the beginning of the function; that part hasn't changed.
Instead of creating a variable <code>username_file</code>, we've chained the call to <code>read_to_string</code> directly onto the result
of <code>File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;)?</code>. We still have a <code>?</code> at the end of the <code>read_to_string</code> call and we still return an <code>Ok</code>
value containing <code>username</code> when both <code>File::open</code> and <code>read_to_string</code> succeed rather than returning errors. The
functionality is again the same as in Listing 9-6 and Listing 9-7; this is just a different, more ergonoomic way to
write it.</p>
<p>Listing 9-9 shows a way to make this even shorter using <code>fs::read_to_string</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::fs;
use std::io;

fn read_username_from_file() -&gt; Result&lt;String, io::Error&gt; {
    fs::read_to_string(&quot;hello.txt&quot;)
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 9-9: Using <code>fs::read_to_string</code> instead of opening and then reading the file</li>
</ul>
<p>Reading a file into a string is a fairly common operation, so the standard library provides the
convenient <code>fs::read_to_string</code> function that opens the file, creates a new <code>String</code>, reads the contents of the file,
puts the contents into that <code>String</code>, and returns it. Of course, using <code>fs::read_to_string</code> doesn't give us the
opportunity to explain all the error handling, so we did it the longer way first.</p>
<h4 id="where-the--operator-can-be-used"><a class="header" href="#where-the--operator-can-be-used">Where the ? Operator Can Be Used</a></h4>
<p>The <code>?</code> operator can only be used in functions whose return type is compatible with the value the <code>?</code> is used on. This
is because the <code>?</code> operator is defined to perform an early return of a value out of the function, in the same manner as
the <code>match</code> expression we defined in Listing 9-6. In Listing 9-6, the <code>match</code> was using a <code>Result</code> value, and the early
return arm returned an <code>Err(e)</code> value. The return type of the function has to be a <code>Result</code> so that it's compatible with
this <code>return</code>.</p>
<p>In Listing 9-10, let's look at the error we'll get if we use the <code>?</code> operator in a <code>main</code> function with a return type
that is incompatible with the type of the value we use <code>?</code> on.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  no playground edition2021">use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;)?;

<ul>
<li>Listing 9-10: Attempting to use the <code>?</code> in the <code>main</code> function that returns <code>()</code> won't compile.</li>
</ul>
<p>This code opens a file, which might fail. The <code>?</code> operator follows the <code>Result</code> value returned by <code>File::open</code>, but
this <code>main</code> function has the return type of <code>()</code>, not <code>Result</code>. When we compile this code, we get the following error
message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0277]: the `?` operator can only be used in a function that returns `Result` or `Option` (or another type that implements `FromResidual`)

</code></pre>
<p>This error points out that we're only allowed to use the <code>?</code> operator in a function that returns <code>Result</code>, <code>Option</code>, or
another type that implements <code>FromResidual</code>.</p>
<p>To fix the error, you have two choices. One choice is to change the return type of your function to be compatible with
the value you're using the <code>?</code> operator on as long as you have no restrictions preventing that. The other choice is to
use a <code>match</code> or one of the <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> methods to handle the <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> in whatever way is appropriate.</p>
<p>The error message also mentioned that <code>?</code> can be used with <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> values as well. As with using <code>?</code> on <code>Result</code>,
you can only use <code>?</code> on <code>Option</code> in a function that returns an <code>Option</code>. The behavior of the <code>?</code> operator when called on
an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> is similar to its behavior when called on a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>: if the value is <code>None</code>, the <code>None</code> will be
returned early from the function at that point. If the value is <code>Some</code>, the value inside the <code>Some</code> is the resultant
value of the expression, and the function continues. Listing 9-11 has an example of a function that finds the last
character of the first line in the given text</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">fn last_char_of_first_line(text: &amp;str) -&gt; Option&lt;char&gt; {
    text.lines().next()?.chars().last()
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 9-11: Using the <code>?</code> operator on an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> value</li>
</ul>
<p>This function returns <code>Option&lt;char&gt;</code> because it's possible that there is a character there, but it's also possible that
there isn't. This code takes the <code>text</code> string slice argument and calls the <code>lines</code> method on it, which returns an
iterator over the lines in the string. Because this function wants to examine the first line, it calls <code>next</code> on the
iterator to get the first value from the iterator. If <code>text</code> is the empty string, this call to <code>next</code> will
return <code>None</code>, in which case we use <code>?</code> to stop and return <code>None</code> from <code>last_char_of_first_line</code>. If <code>text</code> is not the
empty string, <code>next</code> will return a <code>Some</code> value containing a string slice of the first line in <code>text</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>?</code> extracts the string slice, and we call call <code>chars</code> on that string slice to get an iterator of its characters.
We're interested in the last character in this first line, so we call <code>last</code> to return the last item in the iterator.
This is an <code>Option</code> because it's possible that the first line is the empty string; for example, if <code>text</code> starts with a
black line but has characters on other lines, as in <code>&quot;\nhi&quot;</code>. However, if there is a last character on the first line,
it will be returned in the <code>Some</code> variant. The <code>?</code> operator in the middle gives us a concise way to express this logic,
allowing us to implement the function in one line. If we couldn't use the <code>?</code> operator on <code>Option</code>, we'd have to
implement this logic using more method calls or a <code>match</code> expression.</p>
<p>Note that you can use the <code>?</code> operator on a <code>Result</code> in a function that returns <code>Result</code>, and you can use the <code>?</code>
operator on an <code>Option</code>. in a function that returns <code>Option</code>, but you can't mix and match. The <code>?</code> operator won't
automatically convert a <code>Result</code> to an <code>Option</code> or vice versa; in those cases, you can use methods like the <code>ok</code> method
on <code>Result</code> or the <code>ok_or</code> method on <code>Option</code> to do the conversion explicitly.</p>
<p>So far, all the <code>main</code> functions we've used return <code>()</code>. The <code>main</code> function is special because it's the entry point and
exit point of an executable program, and there are restrictions on what its return type can be for the program to behave
as expected.</p>
<p>Luckily, <code>main</code> can also return a <code>Result&lt;(), E&gt;</code>. Listing 9-12 has the code from Listing 9-10, but we've changed the
return type of <code>main</code> to be <code>Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt;</code> and added a return value <code>Ok(())</code> to the end. This code will
now compile.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::error::Error;
use std::fs::File;

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; {
    let greeting_file = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;)?;

    Ok(())
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 9-12: Changing <code>main</code> to return <code>Result&lt;(), E&gt;</code> allows the use of the <code>?</code> operator on <code>Result</code> values.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;</code> type is a trait object, which we'll talk about in &quot;Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of
Different Types&quot;. For now, you can read <code>Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;</code> to mean &quot;any kind of error&quot;. Using <code>?</code> on a <code>Result</code> value in
a <code>main</code> function with the error type <code>Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;</code> is allowed because it allows any <code>Err</code> value to be returned
early. Even though the body of this <code>main</code> function will only ever return errors to type <code>std::io::Error</code>, by
specifying <code>Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;</code>, this signature will continue to be correct even if more code that returns other errors is
added to the body of <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>When a <code>main</code> function returns a <code>Result&lt;(), E&gt;</code>, the executable will exit with a value of <code>0</code> if <code>main</code>
returns <code>Ok(())</code> and will exit with a nonzero value if <code>main</code> returns an <code>Err</code> value. Executables written in C return
integers when they exit: programs that exit successfully return the integer <code>0</code>, and programs that error return some
integer other than <code>0</code>. Rust also returns integers from executables to be compatible with this convention.</p>
<p>The <code>main</code> function may return any types that implement the <code>std::process::Termination</code> trait, which contains a
function <code>report</code> that returns an <code>ExitCode</code>. Consult the standard library documentation for more information on
implementing the <code>Termination</code> trait for your own types.</p>
<p>Now that we've discussed the details of calling <code>panic!</code> or returning <code>Result</code>, let's return to the topic of how to
decide which is appropriate to use in which cases.</p>
<h2 id="to-panic-or-not-to-panic"><a class="header" href="#to-panic-or-not-to-panic">To panic! or Not to panic!</a></h2>
<p>So how do you decide when you should call <code>panic!</code> and when you should return <code>Result</code>? When code panics, there's no way
to recover. You could call <code>panic!</code> for any error situation, whether there's a possible way to recover or not, but then
you're making the decision that a situation is unrecoverable on behalf of the calling code. When you choose to return
a <code>Result</code> value, you give the calling code options. The calling code could choose to attempt to recover in a way that's
appropriate for its situation, or it could decide that an <code>Err</code> value in this case is unrecoverable, so it can
call <code>panic!</code> and turn your recoverable error into an unrecoverable one. Therefore, returning <code>Result</code> is a good default
choice when you're defining a function that might fail.</p>
<p>In situations such as examples, prototype code, and tests, it's more appropriate to write code that panics instead of
returning a <code>Result</code>. Let's explore why, then discuss situations in which the compiler can't tell that failure is
impossible, but you as a human can. The chapter will conclude with some general guidelines on how to decide whether to
panic in library code.</p>
<h3 id="examples-prototype-code-and-tests"><a class="header" href="#examples-prototype-code-and-tests">Examples, Prototype Code, and Tests</a></h3>
<p>When you're writing an example to illustrate some concept, also including robust error-handling code can make the
example less clear. In examples, it's understood that a call to a method like <code>unwrap</code> that could panic is meant as a
place holder for the way you'd want your application to handle errors, which can differ based on what the rest of your
code is doing.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <code>unwrap</code> and <code>expect</code> methods are very handy when prototyping, before you're ready to decide how to
handle errors. They leave clear markers in your code for when you're ready to make your program more robust.</p>
<p>If a method call fails in a test, you'd want the whole test to fail, even if that method isn't the functionality under
test. Because <code>panic!</code> is how a test is marked as a failure, calling <code>unwrap</code> or <code>expect</code> is exactly what should happen.</p>
<h3 id="cases-in-which-you-have-more-information-than-the-compiler"><a class="header" href="#cases-in-which-you-have-more-information-than-the-compiler">Cases in Which You Have More Information Than the Compiler</a></h3>
<p>It would also be appropriate to call <code>unwrap</code> or <code>expect</code> when you have some other logic that ensures the <code>Result</code> will
have an <code>Ok</code> value, but the logic isn't something the compiler understands. You'll still have a <code>Result</code> value that you
need to handle: whatever operation you're calling still has the possibility of failing in general, even though it's
logically impossible in your particular situation. If you can ensure by manually inspecting the code that you'll never
have an <code>Err</code> variant, it's perfectly acceptable to call <code>unwrap</code>, and even better to document the reason you think
you'll never have an <code>Err</code> variant in the <code>expect</code> text. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">use std::net::IpAddr;

let home: IpAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
    .parse()
    .expect(&quot;Hardcoded IP address should be valid&quot;);</code></pre>
<p>We're creating an <code>IpAddr</code> instance by parsing a hardcoded string. We can see that <code>127.0.0.1</code> is a valid IP address, so
it's acceptable to use <code>expect</code> here. However, having a hardcoded valid string doesn't change the return type of
the <code>parse</code> method: we still get a <code>Result</code> value, and the compiler will still make us handle the <code>Result</code> as if
the <code>Err</code> variant is a possibility because the compiler isn't smart enough to see that this string is always a valid IP
address. If the IP address string came from a user rather than being hardcoded into the program and therefore did have a
possibility of failure, we'd definitely want to handle the <code>Result</code> in a more robust way instead. Mentioning the
assumption that this IP address is hardcoded will prompt us to change <code>expect</code> to better error-handling code if, in the
future, we need to get the IP address from some other source instead.</p>
<h3 id="guidelines-for-error-handling"><a class="header" href="#guidelines-for-error-handling">Guidelines for Error Handling</a></h3>
<p>It's advisable to have your code panic when it's possible that your code could end up in a bad state. In this context, a
bad state is when some assumption, guarantee, contract, or invariant has been broken, such as when invalid values,
contradictory values, or missing values are passed to your code - plus one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bad state is something that is unexpected, as opposed to something that will likely happen occasionally, like a
user entering data in the wrong format.</li>
<li>Your code after this point needs to rely on not being in this bad state, rather than checking for the problem at every
step.</li>
<li>There's not a good way to encode this information in the types you use. We'll work through an example of what we mean
in &quot;Encoding States and Behavior as Types&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone calls your code and passes in values that don't make sense, it's best to return an error if you can so the
user of the library can decide what they want to do in that case. However, in cases where continuing could be insecure
or harmful, the best choice might be to call <code>panic!</code> and alert the person using your library to the bug in their code
so they can fix it during development. Similarly, <code>panic!</code> is often appropriate if you're calling external code that is
out of your control and it returns an invalid state that you have no way of fixing.</p>
<p>However, when failure is expected, it's more appropriate to return an <code>Result</code> than to make a <code>panic!</code> call. Examples
include a parser being given malformed data or an HTTP request returning a status that indicates you have hit a rate
limit. In these cases, returning a <code>Result</code> indicates that failure is an expected possibility that the calling code must
decide how to handle.</p>
<p>When your code performs an operation that could put a user at risk if it's called using invalid values your code should
verify the values are valid first and panic if the values aren't valid. This is mostly for safety reasons: attempting to
operate on invalid data can expose your code to vulnerabilities. This is the main reason the standard library will
call <code>panic!</code> if you attempt an out-of-bounds memory access: trying to access memory that doesn't belong to the current
data structure is a common security problem. Functions often have contracts: their behavior is only guaranteed if the
inputs meet particular requirements. Panicking when the contract is violated makes sense because a contract violation
always indicates a caller-side bug, and it's not a kind or error you want the calling code to have to explicitly handle.
In fact, there's no reasonable way for calling code to recover; the calling programmers need to fix the code. Contracts
for a function, especially when a violation will cause a panic, should be explained in the API documentation for the
function.</p>
<p>However, having lots of error checks in all of your functions would be verbose and annoying. Fortunately, you can use
Rust's type system (and thus the type checking done by the compiler) to do many of the checks for you. If your function
has a particular type as a parameter, you can proceed with your code's logic knowing that the compiler has already
ensured you have a valid value. For example, if you have a type rather than an <code>Option</code>, your program expects to have
something rather than nothing. Your code then doesn't have to handle two cases for the <code>Some</code> and <code>None</code> variants: it
will only have one case for definitely having a value. Code trying to pass nothing to your function won't even compile,
so your function doesn't have to check for that case at runtime. Another example is using an unsigned integer type such
as <code>u32</code>, which ensures the parameter is never negative.</p>
<h3 id="creating-custom-types-for-validation"><a class="header" href="#creating-custom-types-for-validation">Creating Custom Types for Validation</a></h3>
<p>Let's take the idea of using Rust's type system to ensure we have a valid value one step further and look at creating a
custom type for validation. Recall the guessing game in Chapter 2 in which our code asked the user to guess a number
between 1 and 100. We never validated that the user's guess was between those numbers before checking it against our
secret number; we only validated that the guess was positive. In this case, the consequences were not very dire: our
output of &quot;Too high&quot; or &quot;Too low&quot; would still be correct. But it would be a useful enhancement to guide the user toward
valid guesses and have different behavior when the user guesses a number that's out of range versus when the user types,
for example, letters instead.</p>
<p>One way to do this would be to parse the guess as an <code>i32</code> instead of only a <code>u32</code> to allow potentially negative
numbers, and then add a check for the number being in range, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">loop {
    // snip

    let guess: i32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
        Ok(num) =&gt; num,
        Err(_) =&gt; continue,
    };

    if guess &lt; 1 || guess &gt; 100 {
        println!(&quot;The secret number will be between 1 and 100.&quot;);
        continue;
    }

    match guess.cmp(&amp;secret_number) {
        // snip

}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>if</code> expression checks whether our value is out of range, tells the user about the problem, and calls <code>continue</code> to
start the next iteration of the loop and ask for another guess. After the <code>if</code> expression, we can proceed with the
comparisons between <code>guess</code> and the secret number knowing that <code>guess</code> is between 1 and 100.</p>
<p>However, this is not an ideal solution: if it were absolutely critical that the program only operated on values between
1 and 100, and it had many functions with this requirement, having a check like this in every function would be
tedious (and might impact performance).</p>
<p>Instead, we can make a new type and put the validations in a function to create an instance of the type rather than
repeating the validations every where. That way, it's safe for functions to use the new type in their signatures and
confidently use the values they receive. Listing 9-13 shows one way to define a <code>Guess</code> type that will only create an
instance of <code>Guess</code> if the <code>new</code> function receives a value between 1 and 100.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplayground">pub struct Guess {      // 1
    value: i32,
}

impl Guess {
    pub fn new(value: i32) -&gt; Guess {       // 2
        if value &lt; 1 || value &gt; 100 {       // 3
            panic!(     // 4
                &quot;Guess value must be between 1 and 100, got {}.&quot;,
                value
            );
        }
        
        Guess { value }     // 5
    }
    
    pub fn value(&amp;self) -&gt; i32 {        // 6
        self.value
    }
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Listing 9-13: A <code>Guess</code> type that will only continue with values between 1 and 100</li>
</ul>
<p>First we define a struct named <code>Guess</code> that has a field named <code>value</code> that holds an <code>i32</code> (1). This is where the number
will be stored.</p>
<p>Then we implement an associated function named <code>new</code> on <code>Guess</code> that creates instances of <code>Guess</code> values (2). The <code>new</code>
function is defined to have one parameter named <code>value</code> of type <code>i32</code> and to return a <code>Guess</code>. The code in the body of
the <code>new</code> function tests <code>value</code> to make sure it's between 1 and 100 (3). If <code>value</code> doesn't pass this test, we make
a <code>panic!</code> call (4), which will alert the programmer who is writing the calling code that they have a bug they need to
fix, because creating a <code>Guess</code> with a <code>value</code> outside this range would violate the contract that <code>Guess::new</code> is
relying on. The conditions in which <code>Guess::new</code> might panic should be discussed in its public-facing API documentation;
we'll cover documentation conventions indicating the possibility of a <code>panic!</code> in the API documentation conventions
indicating the possibility of a <code>panic!</code> in the API documentation that you create in Chapter 14. If <code>value</code> does pass
the test, we create a new <code>Guess</code> with its <code>value</code> field set to the <code>value</code> parameter and return the <code>Guess</code> (5).</p>
<p>Next, we implement a method named <code>value</code> that borrows <code>self</code>, doesn't have any other parameters, and returns an <code>i32</code> (
6). This kind of method is sometimes called a getter because its purpose is to get some data from its fields and return
it. This public method is necessary because the <code>value</code> field of the <code>Guess</code> struct is private. It's important that
the <code>value</code> field be private so code using the <code>Guess</code> struct is not allowed to set <code>value</code> directly: code outside the
module must use the <code>Guess::new</code> function to create an instance of <code>Guess</code>, thereby ensuring there's no way for
a <code>Guess</code> to have a <code>value</code> that hasn't been checked by the conditions in the <code>Guess::new</code> function.</p>
<p>A function that has a parameter or returns only numbers between 1 and 100 could then declare in its signature that it
takes or returns a <code>Guess</code> rather than an <code>i32</code> and wouldn't need to do any additional checks in its body.</p>
<h2 id="summary-8"><a class="header" href="#summary-8">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Rust's error-handling features are designed to help you write more robust code. The <code>panic!</code> macro signals that your
program is in a state it can't handle and lets you tell the process to stop instead of trying to proceed with invalid or
incorrect values. The <code>Result</code> enum uses Rust's type system to indicate that operations might fail in a way that your
code could recover from. You can use <code>Result</code> to tell code that calls your code that it needs to handle potential
success or failure as well. Using <code>panic!</code> and <code>Result</code> in the appropriate situations will make your code more reliable
in the face of inevitable problems.</p>
<p>Now that you've seen useful ways that the standard library uses generics with the <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> enums, we'll
talk about how generics work and how you can use them in your code.</p>
