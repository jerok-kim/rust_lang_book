# Common Programming Concepts

This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming language and how they work in Rust.
Many programming languages have much in common at their core.
None of the concepts presented in this chapter are unique to Rust, but we'll discuss them in the context of Rust and
explain the conventions around using these concepts.

Specifically, you'll learn about variables, basic types, functions, comments, and control flow.
These foundations will be in every Rust program, and learning them early will give you a strong core to start from.

> #### Keywords
>
> The Rust language has a set of keywords that are reserved for use by the language only, much as in other languages.
> Keep in mind that you cannot use these words as names of variables or functions. Most of the keywords have special
> meanings, and you'll be using them to do various tasks in your Rst programs; a few have no current functionality
> associated with them but have been reserved for functionality that might be added to Rust in the future.

## Variables and Mutability

As mentioned in "Storing Values with Variables", by default, variables are immutable. This is one of many nudges Rust
gives you to write your code in a way that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that Rust offers. However,
you still have the option to make your variables mutable. Let's explore how and why Rust encourages you to favor
immutability and why sometimes you might want to opt out.

When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can't change that value. To illustrate this, generate
a new project called variables in your projects directory by using `cargo new variables`.

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

Save and run the program using `cargo run`. You should receive an error message regarding an immutability error, as
shown in this output:

```text
error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
 --> src\main.rs:4:5
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         -
  |         |
  |         first assignment to `x`
  |         help: consider making this binding mutable: `mut x`
3 |     println!("The value of x is: {x}");
4 |     x = 6;
  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
```

This example shows how the compiler helps you find errors in your programs. Compiler errors can be frustrating, but
really they only mean your program isn't safely doing what you want it to do yet; they do not mean that you're not a
good programmer! Experienced Rustaceans still get compiler errors.

You received the error message `cannot assign twice to immutable variable 'x'` because you tried to assign a second
value to the immutable `x` variable. It's important that we get compile-time errors when we attempt to change a value
that's designated as immutable because this very situation can lead to bugs. If one part of our code operates on the
assumption that a value will never change and another part of our code changes that value, it's possible that the first
part of the code won't do what it was designed to do. The cause of this kind of bug can be difficult to track down after
the fact, especially when the second piece of code changes the value only sometimes. The Rust compiler guarantees that
when you state that a value won't change, it really won't change, so you don't have to keep track of it yourself. Your
code is thus easier to reason through.

But mutability can be very useful, and can make code more convenient to write. Although variables are immutable by
default, you can make them mutable by adding `mut` in front of the variable name as you did in Chapter 2.

Adding `mut` also conveys intent to future readers of the code by indicating that other parts of the code will be
changing this variable's value.

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

We're allowed to change the value bound to `x` from 5 to 6 when `mut` is used. Ultimately, deciding whether to use
mutability or ot is up to you and depends on what you think is clearest in that particular situation.

### Constants

Like immutable variables, constants are values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change, but there are a
few differences between constants and variables.

First, you aren't allowed to use `mut` with constants. Constants aren't just immutable by default — they're always
immutable. You declare constants using the `const` keyword instead of the `let` keyword, and the type of the value must
be annotated. We'll cover types and type annotations in "Data Types" soon. Just know that you must always annotate the
type.

Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes them useful for values that many parts
of code need to know about.

The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could
only be computed at runtime.

Here's an example of a constant declaration:

```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

The constant's name is `THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS` and its value is set to the result of multiplying 60 (the number of
seconds in a minute) by 60 (the number of minutes in an hour) by 3 (the number of hours we want to count in this
program). Rust's naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words. The compiler is
able to evaluate a limited set of operations at compile time, which lets us choose to write out this value in a way
that's easier to understand and verify, rather than setting this constant to the value 10,800.
See the Rust Reference's section on constant evaluation at (https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/const_eval.html) for
more information on what operations can be used when declaring constants.

Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope in which they were declared. This property
makes constants useful for values in your application domain that multiple parts of the program might need to know
about, such as the maximum number of points any player of a game is allowed to earn, or the speed of light.

Naming hardcoded values used throughout your program as constants is useful in conveying the meaning of that value to
future maintainers of the code. It also helps to have only one place in your code you would need to change if the
hardcoded value needed to be updated in the future.

### Shadowing

As you saw in the guessing game tutorial in Chapter 2, you can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous
variable. Rustaceans say that the first variable is shadowed by the second, which means that the second variable is what
the compiler will see when you use the name of the variable. In effect, the second variable overshadows the first,
taking any uses of the variable name to itself until either it itself is shadowed or the scope ends. We can shadow a
variable by using the same variable's name and repeating the use of the `let` keyword as follows:

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

This program first binds `x` to a value of 5. Then it creates a new variable `x` by repeating `let x =`, taking the
original value and adding 1 so the value of `x` is then 6. Then within an inner scope created with the curly brackets,
the third `let statement also shadows `x` and creates a new variable, multiplying the previous value by 2 to give `
x` a value of 12. When that scope is over, the inner shadowing ends and `x` returns to being 6. When we run this
program, it will output the following:

```text
$ cargo run
   Compiling shadowing v0.1.0 (C:\Users\jerok\projects\study_blog\rust_lang_book\code\ch03\shadowing)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.38s                                                            
     Running `target\debug\shadowing.exe`
The value of x in the inner scope is: 12
The value of x is: 6
```

Shadowing is different from marking a variable as `mut` because we'll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to
reassign to this variable without using the `let` keyword. By using `let`, we can perform a few transformations on a
value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.

The other difference between `mut` and shadowing is that because we're effectively creating a new variable when we use
the `let` keyword again, we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name. For example, say our program asks
a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by inputting space characters, and then we want to store that
input as a number:

```rust, noplayground
# fn main() {
    let spaces = "   ";
    let spaces = spaces.len();
# }
```

The first `spaces` variable is a string type and the second `spaces` variable is a number type. Shadowing thus spares us
from having to come up with different names, such as `spaces_str` and `spaces_num`; instead, we can reuse the
simpler `spaces` name. However, if we try to use `mut` for this, as shown here, we'll get a compile-time error:

```rust, noplayground
# fn main() {
    let mut spaces = "   ";
    spaces = spaces.len();
# }
```

The error says we're not allowed to mutate a variable's type:

```text
error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --> src\main.rs:15:14
   |
14 |     let mut spaces = "   ";
   |                      ----- expected due to this value
15 |     spaces = spaces.len();
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `&str`, found `usize`
```

Now that we've explored how variables work, lt's look at more data types they can have.

## Data Types

Every value in Rust is of a certain data type, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to
work with that data. We'll look at two data type subsets: scalar and compound.

Keep in mind that Rust is statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile
time. The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it. In cases when many
types are possible, such as when we converted a `String` to a numeric type using `parse` in "Comparing the Guess to the
Secret Number", we must add a type annotation, like this:

```rust, noplayground
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
```

If we don't add the `: u32` type annotation shown in the preceiding code, Rust will display the following error, which
means the compiler needs more information from us to know which type we want to use:

```text
error[E0282]: type annotations needed
 --> src\main.rs:2:9
  |
2 |     let guess = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
  |         ^^^^^
  |
help: consider giving `guess` an explicit type
  |
2 |     let guess: _ = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
  |              +++
```

You'll see different type annotations for other data types.

### Scalar Types

A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans,
and characters. You may recognize these from other programming languages. Let's jump into how they work in Rust.

#### Integer Types

An integer is a number without a fractional component. We used one integer type in Chapter 2, the `u32` type. This type
declaration indicates that the value it's associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types starts
with `i` instead of `u`) that takes up 32 bits of space. Table shows the built-in integer types is Rust. We can use any
of these variants to declare the type of an integer value.

| Length  | Signed  | Unsigned |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 8-bit   | `i8`    | `u8`     |
| 16-bit  | `i16`   | `u16`    |
| 32-bit  | `i32`   | `u32`    |
| 64-bit  | `i64`   | `u64`    |
| 128-bit | `i128`  | `u128`   |
| arch    | `isize` | `usize`  |

Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size. Signed and unsigned refer to whether it's
possible for the number to be negative - in other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it (signed) or
whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be represented without a sign (unsigned). It's like writing
numbers on paper: when the sign matters, a number is shown with a plus sign or a minus sign; however, when it's safe to
assume the number is positive, it's shown with no sign. Signed numbers are stored using two's complement representation.

Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2<sup>n-1</sup>) to 2<sup>n-1</sup>-1 inclusive, where n is the number of
bits that variant uses. So an `i8` can store numbers from -(2<sup>7</sup>) to 2<sup>7</sup>-1, which equals -128 to 127.
Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup>-1, so a `u8` can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>8</sup>-1,
which equals 0 to 255.

Additionally, the `isize` and `usize` types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on, which
is denoted in the table as "arch": 64 bits if you're on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you're on a 32-bit
architecture.

You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in the Table. Note that number literals that can be multiple
numeric types allow a type suffix, such as `57u8`, to designate the type. Number literals can also use `_` as a visual
separator to make the number easier to read, such as `1_000`, which will have the same value as if you had
specified `1000`.

| Number literals  | Example     |
|------------------|-------------|
| Decimal          | 98_222      |
| Hex              | 0xff        |
| Octal            | 0o77        |
| Binary           | 0b1111_0000 |
| Byte (`u8` only) | b'A'        |

So how do you know which type of integer to use? If you're unsure, Rust's defaults are generally good places to start:
integer types default to `i32`. The primary situation in which you'd use `isize` or `usize` is when indexing some sort
of collection.

> - Return the value and a Boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the `overflowing_*` methods.
> - Saturate at the value's minimum or maximum values with the `saturating_*` methods.

#### Floating-Point Types

Rust also has two primitive types for floating-point numbers, which are numbers with decimal points. Rust's
floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is `f64`
because on modern CPUs, it's roughly the same speed as `f32` but is capable of more precision. All floating-point types
are signed.

Here's an example that shows floating-point numbers in action:

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0;  // f64
    
    let y: f32 = 3.0;  // f32
}
```

Floating_point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The `f32` type is a single-precision float,
and `f64` has double precision.

#### Numeric Operations

Rust supports the basic mathematical operations you'd expect for all the number types: addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and remainder. Integer division truncates toward zero to the nearest integer. The following
code shows how you'd use each numeric operation in a `let` statement:

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;
    
    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;
    
    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;
    
    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3;  // Results in -1
    
    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```

Each expression in these statements uses a mathematical operator and evaluates to a single value, which is then bound to
a variable. Appendix B contains a list of all operators that Rust provides.

#### The Boolean Type

As in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible values: `true` and `false`. Booleans are
one byte in size. The Boolean type in Rust is specified using `bool`. For example:

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {
    let t = true;
    
    let f: bool = false;  // with explicit type annotation
}
```

The main way to use Boolean values is through conditionals, such as an `if` expression. We'll cover how `if` expressions
work in Rust in "Control Flow".

#### The Character Type

Rust's `char` type is the language's most primitive alphabetic type. Here are some examples of declaring `char` values:

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = 'Z';  // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = '😻';
}
```

Note that we specify `char` literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes.
Rust's `char` type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode scalar value, which means it can represent a lot more
than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all
valid `char` values in Rust. Unicode scalar values range from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to `U+10FFFF` inclusive.
However, a "character" isn't really a concept in Unicode, so your haman intuition for what a "character" is may not
match up with what a `char` is in Rust. We'll discuss this topic in detail in "Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings".

### Compound Types

Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

#### The Tuple Type

A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples
have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type,
and the types of the different values in the tuple don't have to be the same. We've added optional type annotations in
this example:

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

The variable `tup` binds to the entire tuple because a tuple is considered a single compound element. To get the
individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
    
    let (x, y, z) = tup;
    
    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```

This program first creates a tuple and binds it to the variable `tup`. It then uses a pattern with `let` to take `tup`
and turn it into three separate variables, `x`, `y`, and `z`. This is called destructuring because it breaks the single
tuple into three parts. Finally, the program prints the value of `y`, which is 6.4.

We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (`.`) followed by the index of the value we want to
access. For example:

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    
    let five_hundred = x.0;
    let six_point_four = x.1;
    let one = x.2;
}
```

This program creates the tuple `x` and then accesses each element of the tuple using their respective indices. As with
most programming languages, the first index in a tuple is 0.

The tuple without any values has a special name, unit. This value and its corresponding type are both written `()` and
represent an empty value or an empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don't return any
other value.

#### The Array Type

Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an array. Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must
have the same type. Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.

We write the values in an array as a comma-separated list inside square brackets:

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```

Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap (we will discuss the stack and the
heap more in Chapter 4) or when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements. An array isn't as
flexible as the vector type, though. A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that is
allowed to grow or shrink in size. If you're unsure whether to use an array or a vector, chances are you should use a
vector. Chapter 8 discusses vectors in more detail.

However, arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements will not need to change. For example, if you were
using the names of the month in the program, you would probably use an array rather than a vector because you know it
will always contain 12 elements:

```rust, noplayground
let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",
"August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
```

You write an array's type using square brackets with the type of each element, a semicolon, and then the number of
elements in the array, like so:

```rust, noplayground
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

Here, `i32` is the type of each element. After the semicolon, the number 5 indicates the array contains five elements.

You can also initialize an array to contain the same value for each element by specifying the initial value, followed by
a semicolon, and then the length of the array in square brackets, as shown here:

```rust, noplayground
let a = [3; 5];
```

The array named `a` will contain 5 elements that will all be set to the value 3 initially. This is the same as
writing `let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];` but in a more concise way.

#### Accessing Array Elements

An array is a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can be allocated on the stack. You can access elements
of an array using indexing, like this:

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
```

In this example, the variable named `first` will get the value 1 because that is the value at index `[0]` in the array.
The variable named `second` will get the value 2 from index `[1]` in the array.

#### Invalid Array Element Access

Let's see what happens if you try to access an element of an array that is past the end of the array. Say you run this
code, similar to the guessing game in Chapter 2, to get an array index from the user:

```rust, editable
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    println!("Please enter an array index.");

    let mut index = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut index)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let index: usize = index
        .trim()
        .parse()
        .expect("Index entered was not a number");

    let element = a[index];

    println!(
        "The value of the element at index {index} is: {element}"
    );
}
```

This code compiles successfully. If you run this code using `cargo run` and enter 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, the program will
print out the corresponding value at that index in the array. If you instead enter a number past the end of the array,
such as 10, you'll see output like this:

```text
thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10', src\main.rs:19:19
note: Some details are omitted, run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` for a verbose backtrace.
```

The program resulted in a runtime error at the point of using an invalid value in the indexing operation. The program
exited with an error message and didn't execute the final `println!` statement. When you attempt to access an element
using indexing, Rust will check that the index you've specified is less than the array length. If the index is greater
than or equal to the length, Rust will panic. This check has to happen at runtime, especially in this case, because the
compiler can't possibly know what value a user will enter when they run the code later.

This is an example of Rust's memory safety principles in action. In many low-level languages, this kind of check is not
done, and when you provide an incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed. Rust protects you against this kind of
error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory access and continuing. Chapter 9 discusses more of Rust's
error handling and how you can write readable, safe code that neither panics nor allows invalid memory access.

## Functions

Functions are prevalent in Rust code. You've already seen one of the most important functions in the language:
the `main` function, which is the entry point of many programs. You've also seen the `fn` keyword, which allows you to
declare new functions.

Rust code uses snake case as the conventional style for function and variable names, in which all letters are lowercase
and underscores separate words. Here's a program that contains an example function definition:

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function");
}
```

We define a function in Rust by entering `fn` followed by a function name and a set of parentheses. The curly brackets
tell the compiler where the function body begins and ends.

We can call any function we've defined by entering its name followed by a set of parentheses. Because `another_function`
is defined in the program, it can be called from inside the `main` function. Note that we defined `another_function`
after the `main` function in the source code; we could have defined it before as well. Rust doesn't care where you
define your functions, only that they're defined somewhere in a scope that can be seen by the caller.

```text
$ cargo run
Compiling functions v0.1.0 (C:\Users\jerok\projects\study_blog\rust_lang_book\code\ch03\functions)
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.35s
Running `target\debug\functions.exe`
Hello, world!
Another function
```

The lines execute in the order in which they appear in the `main` function. First the "Hello, world!" message prints,
and then `another_function` is called and its message is printed.

### Parameters

We can define functions to have parameters, which are special variables that are part of a function's signature. When a
function has parameters, you can provide it with concrete values for those parameters. Technically, the concrete values
are called arguments, but in casual conversion, people tend to use the words parameter and argument interchangeably for
either the variables in a function's definition or the concrete values passed in when you call a function.

In this version of `another_function` we add a parameter:

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

```text
$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.08s
     Running `target\debug\functions.exe`
The value of x is: 5
```

The declaration of `another_function` has one parameter named `x`. The type of `x` is specified as `i32`. When we pass 5
in to `another_function`, the `println!` macro puts 5 where the pair of curly brackets containing `x` was in the format
string.

In function signatures, you must declare the type of each parameter. This is a deliberate decision in Rust's design:
requiring type annotations in function definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in
the code to figure out what type you mean. The compiler is also able to give more helpful error messages if it knows
what types the function expects.

When defining multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations with commas, like this:

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    print_labeled_measurement(5, 'h');
}

fn print_labeled_measurement(value: i32, unit_label: char) {
    println!("The measurement is: {value}{unit_label}");
}
```

This example creates a function named `print_labeled_measurement` with two parameters. The first parameter is
named `value` and is an `i32`. The second is named `unit_label` and is type `char`. The function then prints text
containing both the `value` and the `unit_label`.

```text
$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.09s
     Running `target\debug\functions.exe`
The measurement is: 5h
```

Because we called the function with 5 as the value for `value` and `h` as the value for `unit_label`, the program output
contains those values.

### Statements and Expressions

Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression. So far, the functions we've
covered haven't included an ending expression, but you have seen an expression as part of a statement. Because Rust is
an expression-based language, this is an important distinction to understand. Other languages don't have the same
distinctions, so let's look at what statements and expressions are and how their differences affect the bodies of
functions.

- Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
- Expressions evaluate to a resultant value.

Let's look at some examples.

We've actually already used statements and expressions. Creating a variable and assigning a value to it with the `let`
keyword is a statement.

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {
    let y = 6;
}
```

Function definitions are also statements; the entire preceding example is a statement in itself.

Statements do not return values. Therefore, you can't assign a `let` statement to another variable, as the following
code tries to do; you'll get an error:

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let x = (let y = 6);
}
```

When you run this program, the error you'll get looks like this:

```text

```

The `let y = 6` statement does not return a value, so there isn't anything for `x` to bind to. This is different from
what happens in other languages, where the assignment returns the value of the assignment. In other languages, you can
write `x = y = 6` and have both `x` and `y` have the value 6; that is not the case in Rust.

Expressions evaluate to a value and make up most of the rest of the code that you'll write in Rust. Consider a math
operation, such as 5 + 6, which is an expression that evaluates to the value 11. Expressions can be part of statements:
the 6 in the statement `let y = 6;` is an expression that evaluates to the value 6. Calling a function is an expression.
Calling a macro is an expression. A new scope block created with curly brackets is an expression, for example:

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let y = {       // 1, 2
        let x = 3;
        x + 1       // 3
    };
    
    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```

The expression (2) is a block that, in this case, evaluates to 4. That value gets bound to `y` as part of the `let`
statement (1). Note the line without a semicolon at the end (3), which is unlike most of the lines you've seen so fat.
Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a
statement, and it will then not return a value. Keep this in mind as you explore function return values and expressions
next.

### Functions with Return Values

Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We don't name return values, but we must declare their type
after an arrow (`->`). In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in
the block of the body of a function. You can return early from a function by using the `return` keyword and specifying a
value, but most functions return the last expression implicitly. Here's an example of a function that returns a value:

```rust, editable
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();
    
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

There are no function calls, macros, or even `let` statements in the `five` function - just the number 5 by itself.
That's a perfectly valid function in Rust. Note that the function's return type is specified too, as `-> i32`. Try
running this code; the output should look like this:

```text
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (C:\Users\jerok\projects\study_blog\rust_lang_book\code\ch03\functions)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.42s                                             
     Running `target\debug\functions.exe`
The value of x is: 5
```

The 5 in `five` is the function's return value, which is why the return type is `i32`. Let's examine this in more
detail. There are two important bits: first the line `let x = five();` shows that we're using the return values of a
function to initialize a variable. Because the function `five` returns a 5, that line is the same as the following:

```rust, noplayground
let x = 5;
```

Second, the `five` function has no parameters and defines the type of the return value, but the body of the functions is
a lonely 5 with no semicolon because it's an expression whose value we want to return.

Let's look at another example:

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

Running this code will printing `The value of x is: 6`. But if we place a semicolon at the end of the line
containing `x + 1`, changing it from an expression to a statement, we'll get an error:

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1;
}
```

```

The main error message, `mismatched types`, reveals the core issue with this code. The definition of the
function `plus_one` says that it will return an `i32`, but statements don't evaluate to a value, which is expressed
by `()`, the unit type. Therefore, nothing is returned, which contradicts the function definition and results in an
error. In this output, Rust provides a message to possibly help rectify this issue: it suggests removing the semicolon,
which would fix the error.

## Commnets

All programmers strive to make their code easy to understand but sometimes extra explanation is warranted. In these
cases, programmers leave
comments in their source code that the compiler will ignore but people reading the source code may find useful.
Here’s a simple comment:

```rust, noplayground
// hello, world
```

In Rust, the idiomatic comment style starts a comment with two slashes,
and the comment continues until the end of the line. For comments that
extend beyond a single line, you’ll need to include `//` on each line, like this:

```rust
// So we're doing something complicated here, long enough that we need
// multiple lines of comments to do it! Whew! Hopefully, this comment will
// explain what's going on.
```

Comments can also be placed at the end of lines containing code:

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {
    let lucky_number = 7;  // I'm feeling lucky today
}
```

But you’ll more often see them used in this format, with the comment
on a separate line above the code it’s annotating:

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {
    // I'm feeling lucky today
    let lucky_number = 7;
}
```

Rust also has another kind of comment, documentation comments,
which we’ll discuss in “Publishing a Crate to Crates.io”.

## Control Flow

The ability to run some code depending on whether a condition is `true` and
to run some code repeatedly while a condition is `true` are basic building
blocks in most programming languages. The most common constructs
that let you control the flow of execution of Rust code are `if` expressions
and loops.

### if Expressions

An `if` expression allows you to branch your code depending on conditions. You provide a condition and then state, "If
this condition is met, run this block of code. If the condition is not met, do not run this block of code."

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```

All `if` expressions start with the keyword `if`, followed by a condition. In this case, the condition checks whether or
not the variable `number` has a value less than 5. We place the block of code execute if the condition is `true`
immediately after the condition inside curly brackets. Blocks of code associated with the conditions in `if` expressions
are sometimes called arms, just like the arms in `match` expressions that we discussed in  "Comparing the GUess to the
Secret Number".

Optionally, we can also include an `else` expression, which we chose to do here, to give the program an alternative
block of code to execute should the condition evaluate to `false`. If you don't provide an `else` expression and the
condition is `false`, the program will just skip the `if` block and move on to the next bit of code.

Let's try changing the value of `number` to a value that makes the condition `false` to see what happens:

```rust, noplayground
let number = 7;
```

     Running `target\debug\branches.exe`
condition was false
```

It's also worth nothing that the condition in this code must be a `bool`. If the condition isn't a `bool`, we'll get an
error. For example, try running the following code:

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number {
        println!("number was three");
    }
}
```

error: could not compile `branches` due to previous error
```

The error indicates that Rust expected a `bool` but got an integer. Unlike languages such as Ruby and JavaScript, Rust
will not automatically try to convert non-Boolean types to a Boolean. You must be explicit and always provide `if` with
a Boolean as its condition. If we want the `if` code block to run only when a number is not equal to 0, for example we
can change the `if` expression to the following:

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number != 0 {
        println!("number was something other than zero");
    }
}
```

#### Handling Multiple Conditions with else if

You can use multiple conditions by combining `if` and `else` and an `else if` expression. For example:

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

This program has four possible paths it can take. After running it, you should see the following output:

```text
$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.08s
     Running `target\debug\branches.exe`
number is divisible by 3
```

When this program executes, it checks each `if` expression in turn and executes the first body for which the condition
evaluates to `true`. Note that even though 6 is divisible by 2, we don't see the output `number is divisible by 2`, nor
do we see the `number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2` text from the `else` block. That's because Rust only executes the
block for the first `true` condition, and once it finds one, it doesn't even check the rest.

Using too many `else if` expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more than one, you might want to refactor
your code. Chapter 6 describes a powerful Rust branching construct called `match` for these cases.

#### Using if in a let Statement

Because `if` is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a `let` statement to assign the outcome to a variable.

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let condition = true;

    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
```

The `number` variable will be bound to a value based on the outcome of the `if` expression.

```text
$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.08s
     Running `target\debug\branches.exe`
The value of number is: 5
```

Remember that blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them, and numbers by themselves are also expressions. In
this case, the value of the whole `if` expression depends on which block of code executes. This means the values that
have the potential to be results from each arm of the `if` must be the same type; the results of both the `if` arms and
the `else` arm were `i32` integers. If the types are mismatched, as in the following example, we'll get an error:

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let condition = true;

    let number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };
    
    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
```

error: could not compile `branches` due to previous error
```

The expression in the `if` block evaluates to an integer, and the expression in the `else` block evaluates to a string.
This won't work because variables must have a single type, and Rust needs to know at compile time what type
the `number variable is, definitively. Knowing the type of `
number` lets the compiler verify the type is valid everywhere we use `
number`. Rust wouldn't be able to do that if the type of `number` was only determined at runtime; the compiler would be
more complex and would make fewer guarantees about the code if it had to keep track of multiple hypothetical types for
any variable.

### Repetition with Loops

It's often useful to execute a block of code more than once. For this task, Rust provides several loops, which will run
through the code inside the loop body to the end and then start immediately back at the beginning.

Rust has three kinds of loops: `loop`, `while`, and `for`.

#### Repeating Code with loop

The `loop` keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to
stop.

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
```

When we run this program, we'll see `again!` printed over and over continuously until we stop the program manually. Most
terminals support the keyboard shortcut CTRL-C to interrupt a program that is stuck in a continual loop.

Rust also provides a way to break out of a loop using code. You can place the `break` keyword within the loop to tell
the program when to stop executing the loop.

We also used `continue` in the guessing game, which in a loop tells the program to skip over any remaining code in this
iteration of the loop and go to the next iteration.

#### Returning Values from Loops

One of the uses of a `loop` is to retry an operation you know might fail, such as checking whether a thread has
completed its job. You might also need to pass the result of that operation out of the loop to the rest of your code. To
do this, you can add the value you want returned after the `break` expression you use to stop the loop; that value will
be returned out of the loop so you can use it, as shown here:

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {result}");
}
```

Before the loop, we declare a variable named `counter` and initialize it to 0. Then we declare a variable named `result`
to hold the value returned from the loop. On every iteration of the loop, we add 1 to the `counter` variable, and then
check whether the `counter` is equal to 10. When it is, we use the `break` keyword with the value `counter * 2`. After
the loop, we use a semicolon to end the statement that assigns the value to `result`. Finally, we print the value
in `result`, which in this case is 20.

#### Loop Labels to Disambiguate Between Multiple Loops

If you have loops within loops, `break` and `continue` apply to the innermost loop at that point. You can optionally
specify a loop label on a loop that you can then use with `break` or `continue` to specify that those keywords apply to
the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop. Loop labels must begin with a single quote.

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!("count = {count}");
        let mut remaining = 10;

        loop {
            println!("remaining = {remaining}");
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }

        count += 1;
    }
    println!("End count = {count}");
}
```

```text
$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.13s
     Running `target\debug\loops.exe`
count = 0
remaining = 10
remaining = 9
count = 1
remaining = 10
remaining = 9
count = 2
remaining = 10
End count = 2
```

Conditional Loops with while

A program will often need to evaluate a condition within a loop. While the condition is `true`, the loop runs. When the
condition ceases to be `true`, the program calls `break`, stopping the loop. It's possible to implement behavior like
this using a combination of `loop`, `if`, `else`, and `break`; you could try that now in a program, if you'd like.
However, this pattern is so common that Rust has a built-in language construct for it, called a `while` loop.

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!("{number}!");

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

This construct eliminates a lot of nesting that would be necessary if you used `loop`, `if`, `else`, and `break`, and
it's clearer. While a condition evaluates to `true`, the code runs; otherwise, it exits the loop.

#### Looping Through a Collection with for

You can choose to use the `while` construct to loop over the elements of a collection, such as an array.

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index < 5 {
        println!("the value is: {}", a[index]);

        index += 1;
    }
}
```

Here, the code counts up through the elements in the array. It starts at index 0, and then loops until it reaches the
final index in the array (that is, when `index < 5` is no longer `true`).

```text
$ cargo run
   Compiling loops v0.1.0 (C:\Users\jerok\projects\study_blog\rust_lang_book\code\ch03\loops)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.60s                                             
     Running `target\debug\loops.exe`
the value is: 10
the value is: 20
the value is: 30
the value is: 40
the value is: 50
```

All five array values appear in the terminal, as expected. Even though `index` will reach a value of 5 at some point,
the loop stops executing before trying to fetch a sixth value from the array.

However, this approach is error prone; we could cause the program to panic if the index value or test condition is
incorrect. For example, if you changed the definition of the `a` array to have four elements but forgot to update the
condition to `while index < 4`, the code would panic. It's also slow, because the compiler adds runtime code to perform
the conditional check or whether the index is within the bounds of the array on every iteration through the loop.

As a more concise alternative, you can use a `for` loop and execute some code for each item in a collection.

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {element}");
    }
}
```

When we run this code, we'll see the same output as previous example. More importantly, we've now increased the safety
of the code and eliminated the chance of bugs that might result from goint beyond the end of the array or not going far
enough and missing some items.

Using the `for` loop, you wouldn't need to remember to change any other code if you changed the number of values in the
array.

The safety and conciseness of `for` loops make them the most commonly used loop construct in Rust. Even in situations in
which you want to run some code a certain number of times, as in the countdown example that used a `while` loop, most
Rustaceans would use a `for` loop. The way to do that would be to use a `Range`, provided by the standard library, which
generates all numbers in sequence starting from one number and ending before another number.

Here's what the countdown would look like using a `for` loop and another method we've not yet talked about, `rev`, to
reverse the range:

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{number}!");
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

This code is a bit nicer, isn't it?

## Summary

You made it! This was a sizable chapter: you learned about variables, scalar and compound data types, functions,
comments, `if` expressions, and loops! To practice with the concepts discussed in this chapter, try building programs to
do the following:

- Convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
- Generate the nth Fibonacci number.
- Print the lyrics to the Christmas carol "The Twelve Days of Christmas," taking advantage of the repetition in the
  song.

When you're ready to move on, we'll talk about a concept in Rust that doesn't commonly exist in other programming
languages: ownership.
